# Story 1.13: AIRuntime ABC + MockAIRuntime (deterministic YAML-driven)

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As an engineer keeping the engine runtime-neutral (NFR-COMPAT-3),
I want an `AIRuntime` abstract base class plus a `MockAIRuntime` driven by deterministic YAML keyed on `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)`,
so that the engine and dispatcher can be developed and tested without any real Claude Code dependency in Epic 1 (FR29, Decision C1 + C2, Architecture §315-§316, §355-§356, §826-§829, §1062).

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1 — `AIRuntime` ABC declares the runtime-neutral contract (epic AC block 1)**

**Given** Story 1.12 complete (`sdlc.state.project_from_journal` shipped at `src/sdlc/state/projection.py`; the substrate stack errors → contracts → concurrency → state → journal is on disk; ADR-015 will be authored by Story 1.12 — verify on disk before starting),
**When** I import `from sdlc.runtime import AIRuntime, AgentResult`,
**Then** the import succeeds and:

1. `AIRuntime` is an `abc.ABC` declaring exactly one abstract method: `async def dispatch(self, prompt: str, context: Mapping[str, object]) -> AgentResult`.
2. `AgentResult` is a frozen pydantic v2 `BaseModel` with `model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid", str_strip_whitespace=False)` and EXACTLY four fields:
   - `output_text: str` — the final response text the runtime would have produced.
   - `tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...] = Field(default_factory=tuple)` — ordered tuple of tool-call records (`Mapping` not `dict` so frozen-ness is real; tuple not list because pydantic v2 `frozen=True` does not deep-freeze list members).
   - `tokens_in: int = Field(ge=0)` — input token count.
   - `tokens_out: int = Field(ge=0)` — output token count.
3. `AIRuntime` declares NO streaming methods (`astream`, `stream`, `dispatch_stream`, etc. are intentionally absent per Decision C1, Architecture §315 + §327: "AIRuntime streaming — defer until a workflow needs it"). A linter check in Task 9 asserts no `stream` or `iter` token appears in `runtime/abc.py` member names.
4. The `AIRuntime` class body has, in this order: a one-line docstring citing Decision C1 + Architecture §355; the `@abstractmethod`-decorated `dispatch` signature; nothing else (no concrete helper methods on the ABC — keep the abstraction surface minimal so v2 implementations have nothing to override accidentally).

**And** the `dispatch` parameter `context` is typed as `Mapping[str, object]` (NOT `dict[str, Any]`): mapping is read-only by Python's protocol; `object` is stricter than `Any` for type-safety. Implementations may treat the mapping as a frozen view; the caller MUST NOT rely on mutation. Document inline: "context carries workflow_step, agent_name, tool_call_budget, and similar dispatch metadata; the v1 surface is open-ended on purpose, formalized later in Story 2A-3."

**And** `runtime/abc.py` MUST stay ≤ 80 LOC (well under the 400 cap; the ABC + AgentResult pydantic model are small). The architecture-stated module footprint (`abc.py + claude.py + mock.py`) puts the ABC at "small declaration", not implementation hub. If overrunning, the LOC budget is wrong — re-examine the design before stretching the cap.

**And** the public API surface exported from `sdlc.runtime` after this story is exactly: `("AIRuntime", "AgentResult", "MockAIRuntime", "MockMissError")`. `ClaudeAIRuntime` is NOT exported (Story 2B-1 owns that file). The `__all__` tuple is in semantic order: ABC → return-type → mock-impl → mock-error; suppress isort with `# noqa: RUF022` per the project convention.

**AC2 — `MockAIRuntime` deterministic YAML loader + dispatch (epic AC block 2)**

**Given** the `MockAIRuntime` implementation at `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py`,
**When** I instantiate `MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=Path("tests/fixtures/mock_responses/"))` and call `await runtime.dispatch(prompt="Plan epic-stripe", context={"workflow_step": "sdlc-epics"})`,
**Then** the implementation:

1. Stores `fixtures_dir: Path` (must be absolute or made absolute via `Path(fixtures_dir).resolve()` at construction time — fail-loud on non-existent path with `MockMissError("fixtures_dir does not exist: <path>")`; do NOT silently create it).
2. Eager-loads ALL `*.yaml` files under `fixtures_dir` at construction time into an in-memory dict `_fixtures: dict[tuple[str, str], _Fixture]` keyed by `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)` where `prompt_hash = "sha256:" + sha256(prompt.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()` (the same prefix-namespaced format as the journal's `before_hash`/`after_hash` per Architecture §514 + Pattern §3 JSON canonicalization rules).
3. On `dispatch(prompt, context)`: extract `workflow_step = str(context.get("workflow_step", ""))`, compute `prompt_hash`, look up `_fixtures[(workflow_step, prompt_hash)]`. Hit → return the fixture's `AgentResult`. Miss → raise `MockMissError("no fixture for (step={workflow_step}, prompt_hash={prompt_hash}); add a YAML at {fixtures_dir}/{workflow_step}.yaml under key {prompt_hash}")` with `details={"step": "fixture_lookup", "workflow_step": workflow_step, "prompt_hash": prompt_hash, "fixtures_dir": str(self.fixtures_dir)}`. The error message MUST name a concrete migration path (the file/key the developer should add) — mirrors Story 1.11/1.12's "name the migration command" error-contract pattern (Decision F3 fail-loud-with-recovery-path).
4. The dispatch is `async def` but performs NO I/O at dispatch time (all fixture reads happened at construction). The `async` keyword is there for API parity with the ABC (which is `async def`) — under the hood the body is `return self._fixtures[key].as_agent_result()`. Document inline: "Mock dispatch is sync-equivalent — `async` is API-shape, not concurrency. Real `ClaudeAIRuntime` (Story 2B-1) WILL await subprocess.run via asyncio.to_thread; abstraction holds because mock awaits a no-op." Use `await asyncio.sleep(0)` ONCE before the lookup so the coroutine actually yields control (prevents the abstraction-adequacy test from masking the dispatcher's `await` semantics — a coroutine that never yields is observably different from one that does, even if the return value is the same; this is the "abstraction adequacy" trap Decision C2 exists to catch).

**And** the YAML fixture format is canonical:

```yaml
# tests/fixtures/mock_responses/sdlc-epics.yaml
# Schema: top-level dict keyed by prompt_hash → fixture record.
# Generated and consumed deterministically; do NOT hand-edit hashes.
"sha256:abc123...64-hex-chars...":
  output_text: |
    Generated epic plan for stripe webhook integration.
    - Epic 1: Webhook signature verification
    - Epic 2: Idempotency layer
  tool_calls:
    - name: write_artifact
      args: {target: "01-Requirement/04-Epics/EPIC-stripe.json", content_hash: "sha256:..."}
  tokens_in: 1234
  tokens_out: 567
```

The schema is enforced by a private `_Fixture` pydantic model in `runtime/mock.py`:

```python
class _Fixture(BaseModel):
    """Internal: validates YAML fixture records at load time. Not exported."""
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", frozen=True, str_strip_whitespace=False)
    output_text: str
    tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...] = Field(default_factory=tuple)
    tokens_in: int = Field(ge=0)
    tokens_out: int = Field(ge=0)

    def as_agent_result(self) -> AgentResult:
        return AgentResult(
            output_text=self.output_text,
            tool_calls=self.tool_calls,
            tokens_in=self.tokens_in,
            tokens_out=self.tokens_out,
        )
```

**And** YAML loading uses `yaml.safe_load` (NEVER `yaml.load` or `yaml.full_load` — Architecture §492 + NFR-SEC-1 + Story 1.8 secret-sanitizer convention). PyYAML is already a top-level project dep at `pyproject.toml:13` (`pyyaml>=6,<7`).

**And** fixture file naming: one YAML file per `workflow_step` value (e.g. `sdlc-epics.yaml`, `sdlc-stories.yaml`, `sdlc-task.yaml`). The loader extracts `workflow_step = path.stem` and indexes every prompt_hash key under that step. Files with no `workflow_step` mapping (e.g. shared metadata) are NOT supported in v1 — fail-loud with `MockMissError("malformed fixture file: top-level must be a mapping of prompt_hash → record")` if encountered.

**And** unit tests in `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_loader.py` verify: (a) load empty fixtures_dir → empty `_fixtures`; (b) load fixtures_dir with one valid YAML file → `_fixtures` has the right keys; (c) load fixtures_dir with malformed YAML → `MockMissError`; (d) load fixtures_dir with non-existent path → `MockMissError`; (e) load fixtures_dir with a YAML whose top-level is not a mapping → `MockMissError`; (f) `dispatch` hit returns the fixture's AgentResult; (g) `dispatch` miss raises `MockMissError` with the exact recovery-path message format.

**AC3 — Determinism: byte-identical AgentResult on repeated dispatch (epic AC block 3)**

**Given** the mock + a fixture file with a single `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)` entry,
**When** I call `await runtime.dispatch(prompt, context)` twice in a row with the same `prompt` and same `context["workflow_step"]`,
**Then** the two `AgentResult` instances are equal under `model_dump(mode="json")` byte-comparison: `r1.model_dump(mode="json") == r2.model_dump(mode="json")` AND the canonical JSON serialization (`json.dumps(r1.model_dump(mode="json"), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":"))`) is byte-identical between calls.

**And** unit tests in `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_determinism.py` verify:

1. `test_dispatch_same_input_returns_byte_identical_result`: dispatch the same `(prompt, context)` 10 times in a loop; assert all 10 results have the same canonical JSON bytes (NOT just `model_dump()`-equal — canonicalize and compare bytes; mirrors Story 1.10's `_canonicalize_state` byte-comparison pattern).
2. `test_dispatch_different_prompts_return_different_results_when_fixtures_differ`: with two fixtures keyed on different `prompt_hash` values, dispatch each prompt and confirm the right fixture is returned (sanity that the hash-key lookup works).
3. `test_dispatch_concurrent_calls_return_consistent_results`: use `asyncio.gather(*[runtime.dispatch(prompt, ctx) for _ in range(20)])` and assert all 20 results are byte-identical (no shared mutable state in the mock — the dispatch is pure with respect to the in-memory `_fixtures` dict; concurrent calls do not race because all reads are read-only).
4. `test_prompt_hash_is_stable_across_python_runs`: hash the same prompt string twice in separate process invocations (use a subprocess test); assert the hex digest matches. This catches accidental introduction of a non-deterministic hash (e.g., someone replacing `sha256` with `hash()` which is randomized per run via `PYTHONHASHSEED`). Run as a fast subprocess test — see Task 6 for the impl pattern (mirror Story 1.10's chaos-test subprocess pattern).

**AC4 — Module boundary enforcement: `engine/`, `dispatcher/` import only via the ABC (epic AC block 4)**

**Given** the boundary enforcement scaffold at `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py:50-144` (post-Story-1.12: `MODULE_DEPS["state"]` includes `"journal"`),
**When** any file under `src/sdlc/engine/` or `src/sdlc/dispatcher/` attempts `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime` or `from sdlc.runtime.claude import ...` (the latter doesn't exist yet but the rule is forward-compatible),
**Then** the boundary-validator pre-commit hook fails with the existing `import violation` message format. Specifically:

1. The current `MODULE_DEPS["runtime"]` at `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py:62-65` declares `forbidden_from=frozenset({"engine", "dispatcher", "state", "journal", "cli"})`. This rule is **already in place** from Story 1.4. **No edit to `MODULE_DEPS` is required by this story.** Verify by reading the boundary script BEFORE starting implementation; if the rule has shifted (e.g., a prior story removed `"engine"` from `forbidden_from`), abort and reconcile.
2. The boundary check is at the module level (`engine` → `runtime` is forbidden as a whole). Today the validator does NOT distinguish `from sdlc.runtime import AIRuntime` (allowed-via-ABC) from `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime` (always forbidden from engine/dispatcher). **Both are flagged today.** This is a known v1 gap — the architecture's "ABC-only import" rule is a stricter posture than the AST validator can express at module-level granularity. Document this gap in ADR-015 Consequences AND add a NEW pre-commit linter (Task 7) `scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py` that asserts:
   - In `engine/` and `dispatcher/`: only `from sdlc.runtime import AIRuntime, AgentResult` is permitted (NOT `from sdlc.runtime.mock import ...`, NOT `from sdlc.runtime.claude import ...`, NOT `from sdlc.runtime.abc import AIRuntime` — the canonical re-export from `sdlc.runtime` is the only allowed surface).
   - In `cli/` (post-Story-1.16): the rule relaxes to allow `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime` for test-only DI (Architecture §1071 names this exception explicitly: "cli/ … runtime (only mock for tests)"). v1 does not have any cli/ files yet, so the rule's permissive case for cli/ is forward-only.
3. The new linter is wired into `.pre-commit-config.yaml` between `boundary-validator` and `state-write-protocol-validator` (alphabetically: it's a `runtime-*` linter, sorts before `secret-*`).

**And** unit tests in `tests/unit/test_runtime_import_via_abc_validator.py` mirror the existing `tests/unit/test_state_write_validator.py` (Story 1.10) and `tests/unit/test_journal_mutation_validator.py` (Story 1.11) patterns: positive test fixtures (lint_negative directory) demonstrate forbidden imports; the validator AST-walks each fixture and asserts violations are reported with line numbers.

**And** negative-test fixtures live at `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/runtime_direct_import.py.txt` (NOT `.py` — fixtures are text files so they don't get collected by pytest or scanned by ruff/mypy; mirror Story 1.10/1.11 fixture convention). Two fixtures: (1) `engine_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` with `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime`; (2) `dispatcher_imports_runtime_claude.py.txt` with `from sdlc.runtime.claude import ClaudeAIRuntime` (forward-compat — even though `runtime/claude.py` doesn't exist yet, the validator must reject the import shape).

**And** the new linter's AST walker is structured to mirror `scripts/check_no_journal_mutation.py` (Story 1.11): a class-based visitor with explicit allow-list of canonical imports, methods named `visit_ImportFrom` / `visit_Import`, returns `list[str]` of human-readable violation messages with line numbers.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Pre-flight verification of dependencies and existing state (AC: all)**
  - [ ] Verify Story 1.12 deliverables on disk: `src/sdlc/state/projection.py` exists; `from sdlc.state import project_from_journal` succeeds in a `uv run python -c` smoke. **Expected at story start (2026-05-09 or later)**: 1.12 status is `ready-for-dev` per sprint-status.yaml; 1.11 is `in-progress`. The runtime story does NOT depend on 1.11/1.12 code (it depends on `errors/`, `contracts/` only) — but ADR-015 from Story 1.12 SHOULD exist before this story's ADR-016. If 1.12's ADR-015 is missing, document the order assumption in this story's ADR-016 (Task 8).
  - [ ] Verify `MODULE_DEPS["runtime"]` at `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py:62-65` matches the expected pre-1.13 form: `depends_on=frozenset({"errors", "contracts", "concurrency"})`, `forbidden_from=frozenset({"engine", "dispatcher", "state", "journal", "cli"})`. If it has been edited (e.g., a prior story added/removed entries), abort and ask user.
  - [ ] Verify `pyyaml>=6,<7` is at `pyproject.toml:13` (top-level project dep). Verify `types-PyYAML` is at `pyproject.toml:30` (mypy stubs, dev dep). Both are already present per Story 1.8 — confirm before relying on them.
  - [ ] Verify `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/` already contains `direct_state_write.py.txt` (Story 1.10) and `journal_mutation.py.txt` (Story 1.11). The new fixtures from this story drop into the same directory; mirror their text-file convention.
  - [ ] Verify ADR numbering: existing ADRs are 001-014 per `docs/decisions/index.md`. Story 1.12 will add ADR-015. Story 1.13 (this story) authors **ADR-016**. If 1.12's ADR-015 has not yet been created, this story's ADR-016 is still the next available — proceed.
  - [ ] Run `uv run python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load.__doc__)"` to confirm `yaml.safe_load` is callable. Run `uv run python -c "import hashlib; print(hashlib.sha256(b'').hexdigest())"` to confirm sha256 produces a stable digest (`e3b0c44...` for empty input).

- [ ] **Task 2: Add `MockMissError` to `errors/base.py` + `errors/__init__.py` (AC: #2)**
  - [ ] Edit `src/sdlc/errors/base.py`: add `MockMissError` class at the end of the existing exception list (after `IdsError` at line 73-74). Inherit from `DispatchError` (NOT `SdlcError` directly): `MockMissError` is a dispatch-time fail-loud condition; `code: ClassVar[str] = "ERR_DISPATCH"` is inherited correctly. Document inline: "MockMissError is raised by `runtime.mock.MockAIRuntime` when a fixture lookup misses or fixture loading fails. Treated as a DispatchError because the mock is a runtime implementation; abstraction-adequacy tests rely on `MockMissError` propagating with `exit_code=2` (same as a real DispatchError)."
  - [ ] Class body:
    ```python
    class MockMissError(DispatchError):
        """MockAIRuntime missing-fixture or malformed-fixture error.

        Raised at construction time (fixtures_dir doesn't exist, malformed YAML)
        and at dispatch time (no fixture matches (workflow_step, prompt_hash)).
        Inherits ERR_DISPATCH code so abstraction-adequacy tests propagate it
        identically to a real Claude dispatch failure.
        """
    ```
    No new `code` ClassVar (inherits `"ERR_DISPATCH"` from `DispatchError`); no new entry in `EXIT_CODE_MAP` (it already maps `"ERR_DISPATCH"` to 2).
  - [ ] Edit `src/sdlc/errors/__init__.py`: add `MockMissError` to imports and `__all__` tuple. Position: after `IdsError`, before `EXIT_CODE_MAP`. Maintain the existing semantic order (root → architecture-canonical 8 → IdsError → MockMissError → EXIT_CODE_MAP); the `# noqa: RUF022` at line 24 already covers the tuple.
  - [ ] Add a unit test in `tests/unit/errors/test_base.py` (extend existing): `test_mock_miss_error_inherits_dispatch_error_code`: instantiate `MockMissError("test")`, assert `e.code == "ERR_DISPATCH"`, `e.exit_code == 2`, `e.to_envelope()["error"]["code"] == "ERR_DISPATCH"`. Mirrors the existing tests for `IdsError` (Story 1.6).
  - [ ] **DO NOT** modify `EXIT_CODE_MAP` itself — `MockMissError` reuses `ERR_DISPATCH=2` exit code by inheritance. Adding a new key would diverge the v1 exit-code surface from the architecture's eight declared codes (Architecture §527-§538).

- [ ] **Task 3: Create `src/sdlc/runtime/abc.py` with `AIRuntime` ABC + `AgentResult` (AC: #1)**
  - [ ] Create `src/sdlc/runtime/__init__.py` with module docstring `"""AIRuntime abstraction (Architecture §826-§829, §1062, Decision C1 + C2).\n\nv1 ships AIRuntime ABC + MockAIRuntime; ClaudeAIRuntime arrives in Story 2B-1.\n"""`. Use semantic-order `__all__` per the existing `state/__init__.py` and `journal/__init__.py` patterns:
    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations

    from sdlc.runtime.abc import AIRuntime, AgentResult
    from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime, MockMissError

    # Semantic order: ABC → return-type → mock-impl → mock-error; do NOT alphabetize.
    __all__ = (  # noqa: RUF022
        "AIRuntime",
        "AgentResult",
        "MockAIRuntime",
        "MockMissError",
    )
    ```
    Note: `MockMissError` is re-exported from `sdlc.runtime` (sourced from `sdlc.errors`) for ergonomics — callers handling mock-specific failures can import everything from one namespace. The canonical home is still `sdlc.errors.MockMissError`; the runtime re-export is a convenience symbol.

    - Concrete (non-abstract) methods on `AIRuntime` other than the abstract `dispatch` — keep the ABC surface minimal.
    - `Any` in the ABC signature — use `Mapping[str, object]` (already strict). The pydantic model's `tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]` allows arbitrary tool-call records but stays type-safe.
    - `dict[str, Any]` for `context` — `Mapping[str, object]` is the canonical narrow form (read-only protocol; `object` is stricter than `Any`).

  - [ ] LOC budget: `runtime/mock.py` ≤ 200 LOC. The above is ~150 LOC; well within budget.
  - [ ] Cross-platform: `runtime/mock.py` is **cross-platform** (PyYAML, pathlib, hashlib are stdlib/portable). No POSIX gate.
  - [ ] **Forbidden patterns at code-review time**:
    - `yaml.load(...)` or `yaml.full_load(...)` — both are unsafe (allow arbitrary Python object construction). Use `yaml.safe_load` only (Architecture §492 + NFR-SEC-1).
    - `open(yaml_path, ...)` — use `Path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")`. Mirrors `state/atomic.py:_normalize_strings` and `journal/writer.py:_canonicalize_entry` text-handling patterns.
    - Bare `except Exception` or `except:` — narrow to `(OSError, yaml.YAMLError)` for I/O; `MockMissError` is re-raised intentionally.
    - `print()` to stdout — runtime modules MUST NOT `print` (Architecture §489: "No print() in engine/, dispatcher/, state/, journal/, hooks/, runtime/"). Errors propagate via `MockMissError`; observability via the `details` dict.
    - `time.time()` for any ordering — irrelevant here (mock has no time-based behavior); flag if a contributor adds timing for "realism" — that breaks AC3 determinism.
    - Lazy-loading fixtures inside `dispatch` — eager-load at construction. Lazy-load is a footgun: malformed YAML detection deferred until first dispatch defeats fail-loud and breaks `MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=...)` as a guard (it should fail at construction, not at first dispatch).

- [ ] **Task 5: Create canonical YAML fixtures directory + 1-2 placeholder fixtures (AC: #2, #3)**
  - [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/` directory if it doesn't exist (`mkdir -p tests/fixtures/mock_responses`).
  - [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/README.md` with the canonical fixture format documentation:
    ```markdown
    # MockAIRuntime YAML Fixtures (Decision C2, Architecture §356, §692, §1012)

    One YAML file per `workflow_step` value. Filename = `<workflow_step>.yaml` (e.g.
    `sdlc-epics.yaml` for `workflow_step="sdlc-epics"`).

    Top-level: mapping of `prompt_hash` (sha256:<hex>) → fixture record.

    Fixture record schema (validated by `_Fixture` pydantic model in `runtime/mock.py`):

    - `output_text: str` — the response text.
    - `tool_calls: list` (default []) — list of tool-call mappings.
    - `tokens_in: int` (≥ 0) — input token count.
    - `tokens_out: int` (≥ 0) — output token count.

    Generate a prompt_hash:
        python -c 'import hashlib; print("sha256:"+hashlib.sha256("YOUR PROMPT".encode("utf-8")).hexdigest())'
    ```
  - [ ] Create one minimal placeholder fixture `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/_smoke.yaml` (underscore-prefixed so it sorts first and is recognizable as a fixture-of-fixtures):
    ```yaml
    # Smoke fixture for MockAIRuntime construction tests.
    # workflow_step="_smoke", prompt="hello".
    # prompt_hash for "hello" = sha256(b"hello") = sha256:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
    "sha256:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824":
      output_text: "hello back"
      tool_calls: []
      tokens_in: 1
      tokens_out: 2
    ```
  - [ ] Verify the prompt hash by running `uv run python -c "import hashlib; print('sha256:' + hashlib.sha256(b'hello').hexdigest())"` — confirm it prints the same digest used in the fixture. (The digest above is the canonical sha256 for `b"hello"`.)
  - [ ] **DO NOT** create per-workflow fixtures (sdlc-epics.yaml, sdlc-task.yaml, etc.) in this story — those are owned by their respective workflow stories (2A-9 onwards). Story 1.13 ships the SHAPE + an idempotent smoke fixture only. Document this scope discipline in Dev Notes.
  - [ ] Add a `.gitkeep` to `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/` if the README + smoke fixture aren't enough to track an empty-but-needed directory; both files above are sufficient, so no `.gitkeep` needed.

- [ ] **Task 6: Unit tests for `runtime/abc.py` and `runtime/mock.py` (AC: #1, #2, #3)**
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/runtime/__init__.py` (empty file — pytest-collection sentinel).
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/runtime/test_abc.py` with these tests (mark `@pytest.mark.unit`):
    - `test_airuntime_is_abc_with_only_dispatch_abstract`: `AIRuntime.__abstractmethods__ == frozenset({"dispatch"})`. No other abstracts.
    - `test_airuntime_cannot_be_instantiated_directly`: `with pytest.raises(TypeError): AIRuntime()` — abstract instantiation guard.
    - `test_airuntime_subclass_must_implement_dispatch`:
      ```python
      class _Incomplete(AIRuntime): pass
      with pytest.raises(TypeError):
          _Incomplete()
      ```
    - `test_airuntime_subclass_with_dispatch_instantiates`:
      ```python
      class _Concrete(AIRuntime):
          async def dispatch(self, prompt: str, context: Mapping[str, object]) -> AgentResult:
              return AgentResult(output_text="ok", tool_calls=(), tokens_in=0, tokens_out=0)
      _Concrete()  # no error
      ```
    - `test_airuntime_has_no_streaming_methods`: assert no member of `AIRuntime` (via `dir(AIRuntime)`) contains the substrings `"stream"` or `"astream"` or `"iter_dispatch"`. This catches accidental introduction of streaming methods.
    - `test_agent_result_is_frozen`:
      ```python
      r = AgentResult(output_text="x", tool_calls=(), tokens_in=0, tokens_out=0)
      with pytest.raises((pydantic.ValidationError, TypeError, AttributeError)):
          r.output_text = "y"
      ```
    - `test_agent_result_extra_field_forbidden`:
      ```python
      with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
          AgentResult(output_text="x", tool_calls=(), tokens_in=0, tokens_out=0, extra_field="nope")
      ```
    - `test_agent_result_negative_token_counts_rejected`:
      ```python
      with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
          AgentResult(output_text="x", tool_calls=(), tokens_in=-1, tokens_out=0)
      ```
    - `test_agent_result_canonical_serialization_is_byte_stable`: build `AgentResult(output_text="hello", tool_calls=({"name": "x", "args": {}},), tokens_in=10, tokens_out=20)`; serialize via `json.dumps(r.model_dump(mode="json"), sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))`; assert the bytes match a hard-coded expected value. This is the canary for a pydantic version that re-orders fields silently.
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_loader.py` with these tests (mark `@pytest.mark.unit`):
    - `test_construct_mock_with_nonexistent_dir_raises`: `with pytest.raises(MockMissError) as ei: MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=tmp_path / "nope")`; assert `ei.value.details["step"] == "fixtures_dir_check"`.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_file_not_dir_raises`: create `tmp_path / "afile.txt"` (touch); `with pytest.raises(MockMissError): MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=tmp_path / "afile.txt")`.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_empty_dir_succeeds`: `tmp_path / "fx"` mkdir; `mock = MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=tmp_path / "fx")`; assert `mock._fixtures == {}`.
    - `test_construct_mock_loads_single_yaml_fixture`: write `tmp_path / "fx" / "hello.yaml"` with the smoke fixture contents (1 record); construct mock; assert `mock._fixtures` has the right `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)` key.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_malformed_yaml_raises`: write `tmp_path / "fx" / "bad.yaml"` with `"key: value: bad"` (YAML syntax error); `with pytest.raises(MockMissError) as ei: MockAIRuntime(...)`; assert `ei.value.details["step"] == "fixture_yaml_parse"`.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_top_level_list_raises`: write `tmp_path / "fx" / "list.yaml"` with `- item1\n- item2\n` (top-level list, not mapping); `with pytest.raises(MockMissError): MockAIRuntime(...)`; assert `details["step"] == "fixture_yaml_shape"`.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_non_sha256_key_raises`: write a YAML with a key like `not-a-hash:`; assert `MockMissError(details["step"] == "fixture_key_shape")`.
    - `test_construct_mock_with_extra_field_in_record_raises`: write a YAML with a record having `extra_field: x`; assert `pydantic.ValidationError` is raised (not `MockMissError` — `_Fixture.model_validate` rejects with pydantic's exception; this is intentional — fixture schema errors surface as schema errors).
    - `test_construct_mock_with_negative_tokens_raises`: write a YAML with `tokens_in: -1`; assert `pydantic.ValidationError`.
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_dispatch.py` with these tests (mark `@pytest.mark.unit`; need `pytest-asyncio` style — use `asyncio.run(...)` directly to avoid adding new test deps; pytest-asyncio is NOT in the project's dev-deps per `pyproject.toml:21-31`):
    - `test_dispatch_hit_returns_fixture_result`:
      ```python
      def test_dispatch_hit_returns_fixture_result(tmp_path):
          # build fixtures dir with the smoke fixture
          ...
          mock = MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=fx_dir)
          result = asyncio.run(mock.dispatch("hello", {"workflow_step": "smoke"}))
          assert result.output_text == "hello back"
          assert result.tokens_in == 1
          assert result.tokens_out == 2
      ```
    - `test_dispatch_miss_raises_mock_miss_error`:
      ```python
      with pytest.raises(MockMissError) as ei:
          asyncio.run(mock.dispatch("not-in-fixtures", {"workflow_step": "smoke"}))
      assert ei.value.details["step"] == "fixture_lookup"
      assert "add a YAML at" in str(ei.value)  # recovery-path message
      ```
    - `test_dispatch_miss_includes_correct_prompt_hash_in_message`: dispatch a known prompt; catch `MockMissError`; assert the message contains the sha256 hex digest matching `hashlib.sha256(b"<prompt>").hexdigest()`.
    - `test_dispatch_miss_when_workflow_step_missing`: dispatch with `context={}` (no `workflow_step` key); `workflow_step` defaults to `""`; lookup misses; assert `MockMissError(details["workflow_step"] == "")`.
    - `test_dispatch_yields_control_at_least_once`: assert that the `dispatch` coroutine yields control by checking that `asyncio.run(asyncio.gather(mock.dispatch(...), mock.dispatch(...)))` interleaves (use a custom `asyncio.events.AbstractEventLoop` mock or assert that `dispatch.__code__.co_consts` references `asyncio.sleep` — the latter is more brittle; prefer the gather-based test). The point is to catch a refactor that removes `await asyncio.sleep(0)` and breaks abstraction-adequacy.
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_determinism.py` with these tests (AC3):
    - `test_dispatch_same_input_returns_byte_identical_result`:
      ```python
      results = [asyncio.run(mock.dispatch("hello", {"workflow_step": "smoke"})) for _ in range(10)]
      canonical = [json.dumps(r.model_dump(mode="json"), sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":")).encode("utf-8") for r in results]
      assert all(c == canonical[0] for c in canonical), "non-deterministic mock!"
      ```
    - `test_dispatch_concurrent_calls_return_byte_identical_results`:
      ```python
      async def _run():
          return await asyncio.gather(*[mock.dispatch("hello", {"workflow_step": "smoke"}) for _ in range(20)])
      results = asyncio.run(_run())
      ... canonical-bytes check as above ...
      ```
    - `test_prompt_hash_is_stable_across_python_runs`:
      ```python
      def test_prompt_hash_is_stable_across_python_runs(tmp_path):
          script = tmp_path / "hash.py"
          script.write_text("from sdlc.runtime.mock import _hash_prompt; print(_hash_prompt('hello'))")
          out1 = subprocess.run(["uv", "run", "python", str(script)], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout.strip()
          out2 = subprocess.run(["uv", "run", "python", str(script)], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout.strip()
          assert out1 == out2 == "sha256:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824"
      ```
      Mark `@pytest.mark.integration` (not unit) — it spawns subprocesses; mirrors Story 1.10 chaos-test pattern. SKIP on Windows if `uv` is not available; check via `shutil.which("uv")`.
  - [ ] Per-package coverage gate: `sdlc.runtime` must reach ≥95% line coverage. The above test set covers all branches (fixtures-dir errors, YAML parse errors, shape errors, key errors, hit, miss, determinism). Run `uv run pytest tests/unit/runtime/ --cov=src/sdlc/runtime --cov-report=term-missing` and confirm.

- [ ] **Task 7: Create runtime-import-via-ABC linter + pre-commit hook (AC: #4)**
  - [ ] Create `scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py` modeled on `scripts/check_no_journal_mutation.py` (Story 1.11) and `scripts/check_no_direct_state_writes.py` (Story 1.10):
    ```python
    """Runtime ABC-only import validator (AC4 / Architecture §1106 / Story 1.13).

    from __future__ import annotations

    import ast
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    GUARDED_PARENTS = ("src/sdlc/engine/", "src/sdlc/dispatcher/")

        ... allow sdlc.runtime (no dot suffix) anywhere
        ... emit messages with line numbers
    ```
    The linter is class-light (a few helper functions + AST visitor); aim for ≤ 200 LOC. Mirror the structure of `check_no_journal_mutation.py` for consistency with Stories 1.10/1.11.
  - [ ] Wire the new hook into `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Place it BETWEEN `journal-append-only-validator` (line 71) and `secret-hardcode-validator` (line 81):
    ```yaml
    # ----- runtime ABC-only import validator (Story 1.13 / AC4 / Architecture §1106) -----
    - repo: local
      hooks:
        - id: runtime-import-via-abc-validator

          entry: uv run python scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py
          language: system
          types: [python]
          files: ^src/sdlc/.*\.py$
          pass_filenames: true
    ```
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit/test_runtime_import_via_abc_validator.py` mirroring `tests/unit/test_journal_mutation_validator.py` (Story 1.11). Test cases:
    - `test_validator_allows_canonical_import_in_engine`: AST-walk a fixture with `from sdlc.runtime import AIRuntime`; assert no violations.
    - `test_validator_flags_mock_direct_import_in_engine`: AST-walk fixture `engine_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt`; assert one violation with the right line number.
    - `test_validator_flags_claude_direct_import_in_dispatcher`: similarly for `dispatcher_imports_runtime_claude.py.txt`.
    - `test_validator_flags_abc_direct_import_in_engine`: `from sdlc.runtime.abc import AIRuntime` is forbidden (caller must use the re-export); assert violation.
    - `test_validator_allows_mock_direct_import_in_cli`: `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime` in `src/sdlc/cli/foo.py` is allowed (Architecture §1071 cli permissive case); no violation. NOTE: cli/ doesn't exist yet — fixture lives at `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/cli_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` and the test mocks the file's path-prefix check.
    - `test_validator_ignores_non_engine_dispatcher_files`: AST-walk a fixture in `state/` with the mock import; not flagged (state/'s `runtime` access is governed by `MODULE_DEPS["state"].forbidden_from` which is enforced separately).
  - [ ] Create the negative-test fixtures:
    - `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/engine_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` (one-liner: `from sdlc.runtime.mock import MockAIRuntime`)
    - `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/dispatcher_imports_runtime_claude.py.txt` (one-liner: `from sdlc.runtime.claude import ClaudeAIRuntime  # forward-compat: file doesn't exist yet`)
    - `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/engine_imports_runtime_abc.py.txt` (one-liner: `from sdlc.runtime.abc import AIRuntime`)
    - `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/cli_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` (one-liner — included for forward-compat documentation; the cli permissive case test references this)
  - [ ] Run `uv run python scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py src/sdlc/engine/ src/sdlc/dispatcher/` (these directories are empty pre-1.15) — should exit 0 (no Python files to scan). Run with the negative fixtures via `uv run python scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py tests/fixtures/lint_negative/engine_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` — expect exit 1 with the violation message.

  - [ ] Create `docs/decisions/ADR-016-airuntime-abc-and-mock-implementation.md` with sections:
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2026-05-09 (or system date when the story is dev'd)
    - **Story:** 1.13
    - **Context:** Decision C1 + C2 (Architecture §315-§316, §355-§356) require an async dispatch ABC plus a deterministic Mock for the abstraction-adequacy CI test (Story 1.14). FR29 + NFR-COMPAT-3 require runtime-neutrality from v1. Architecture §1062 declares `AIRuntime`, `AgentResult`, `ClaudeAIRuntime`, `MockAIRuntime` as the runtime/ public API; this story ships the first three (Claude is Story 2B-1).
    - **Decision:**
      1. ABC at `src/sdlc/runtime/abc.py`: single `@abstractmethod async def dispatch(prompt, context) -> AgentResult`. No streaming (Decision C1, deferred per §327).
      2. `AgentResult` is a frozen pydantic model with 4 fields: `output_text, tool_calls, tokens_in, tokens_out` (Architecture §355).
      3. Mock at `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py`: eager-loads `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/*.yaml` at construction; dispatch keyed by `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)`; missing key raises `MockMissError` with a recovery-path message naming the YAML file + key to add.
      4. New error class `MockMissError(DispatchError)` — inherits `code="ERR_DISPATCH"`, `exit_code=2` so abstraction-adequacy tests propagate identically to a real Claude dispatch failure.
      5. New pre-commit hook `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` enforces Architecture §1106 at AST-level granularity (the existing `boundary-validator` operates at module-level only).
      6. YAML fixture format: top-level mapping of `sha256:<hex>` → `{output_text, tool_calls, tokens_in, tokens_out}`. One file per `workflow_step`.
    - **Alternatives considered:**
      - JSON fixtures instead of YAML — rejected: YAML is human-friendlier for the multi-line `output_text` (Claude responses are paragraphs), and PyYAML is already a top-level dep. Determinism is preserved by using `yaml.safe_load` (no Python-object construction).
      - Lazy fixture loading at dispatch — rejected: defeats fail-loud on construction; malformed fixtures would surface only at first miss.
      - Streaming in v1 (`async def stream() -> AsyncIterator[ChunkType]`) — explicitly deferred per Decision C1, Architecture §327.
      - `tool_calls: list[dict]` vs `tuple[Mapping, ...]` — chose tuple+Mapping for real frozen-ness; pydantic v2's `frozen=True` does not deep-freeze list members, so a list would be mutable in practice.
      - Adding a `workflow_step: str` field to `AgentResult` so callers can verify they got the right fixture — rejected: leaks mock-impl detail into the contract; the abstraction-adequacy test verifies behavior, not provenance.
    - **Consequences:**
      - Forward-contract: `MockMissError` message names YAML file + key — future Story 2A-9+ will add per-workflow fixtures keyed by exactly this format.
      - The new `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` is a stricter posture than `boundary-validator` (which is module-level). Adding a future fourth runtime (e.g. Cursor in v2) means adding a new file under `runtime/` and updating ALLOWED_RUNTIME_IMPORTS only if the new runtime needs a CLI re-export pattern — typical case is no validator change needed.
      - `_Fixture` and `_load_fixtures` are private to `runtime/mock.py` (single-underscore prefix; not in `__all__`). If a future story (e.g., 2B-3 abstraction-adequacy mock-vs-claude) needs to introspect fixtures, that's the time to promote them — premature promotion now is YAGNI.
      - Coverage: `runtime/mock.py` lives in coverage scope; expect ≥95% line coverage from this story's tests. `runtime/abc.py` is small enough that ABC instantiation tests cover it trivially.
    - **References:** Architecture §315-§316, §327, §355-§356, §692, §826-§829, §1012, §1062, §1106. PRD §FR29, §NFR-COMPAT-3. ADR-013 (atomic state write protocol — pattern precedent). ADR-014 (append-only journal protocol — error-message-as-contract precedent). ADR-015 (state projection — fail-loud-with-recovery-path precedent — depends on Story 1.12 landing first; if 1.12's ADR-015 is missing at story-author time, document the order assumption here).
  - [ ] Update `docs/decisions/index.md`: add row `| [016](ADR-016-airuntime-abc-and-mock-implementation.md) | AIRuntime ABC + Mock implementation | 1.13 | Accepted |` after the existing ADR-015 row (which Story 1.12 owns). If Story 1.12 has not yet landed ADR-015 at the time this story is dev'd, place the row in numeric position 016 (preserving the gap; ADR-015 will fill in when 1.12 commits).
  - [ ] Create `docs/CODEMAPS/runtime.md` (or update if it exists) listing this story's deliverables: `runtime/abc.py`, `runtime/mock.py`, `runtime/__init__.py`, the negative-test fixtures, ADR-016, and the new linter. Cross-link to `docs/CODEMAPS/state.md` (Story 1.12) and `docs/CODEMAPS/journal.md` (Story 1.11).
  - [ ] **No new pytest markers** — `unit`, `integration`, `property` already exist (`pyproject.toml:176-183`). The subprocess-based hash-stability test uses `@pytest.mark.integration`.
  - [ ] **No new mypy override** — `runtime/abc.py` and `runtime/mock.py` are cross-platform pure Python with no `Any` leaks. Existing strict mode covers them.
  - [ ] **No new coverage `omit`** — both files are cross-platform and run on every CI matrix cell.

- [ ] **Task 9: Validate full quality gates green (AC: all)**
  - [ ] Run `uv run ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/` → 0 errors.
  - [ ] Run `uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/ scripts/` → all formatted.
  - [ ] Run `uv run mypy --strict src/` → 0 errors. The new `runtime/abc.py`, `runtime/mock.py`, and `runtime/__init__.py` MUST type-check under `--strict` (no `Any` leaks; `Mapping[str, object]`, `tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]`, `dict[tuple[str, str], _Fixture]` typed correctly; `_load_fixtures` return type annotated).
  - [ ] Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` → all hooks pass:
    - `ruff-check`, `ruff-format` (existing)
    - `mypy-strict` (existing)
    - `boundary-validator` (existing; no edit to MODULE_DEPS this story, runtime/ already had `forbidden_from` declared)
    - `state-write-protocol-validator` (Story 1.10; should not flag runtime/ — runtime never opens state.json)
    - `journal-append-only-validator` (Story 1.11; should not flag runtime/ — runtime never opens journal.log)
    - **NEW** `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` (this story's Task 7; runs on engine/, dispatcher/ paths — both empty pre-1.15, so it exits 0 cleanly)
    - `secret-hardcode-validator` (Story 1.8; should not flag runtime/ — no hardcoded secrets in mock fixtures or in the python files)
    - `specialist-validator` (placeholder; runs always)
  - [ ] Run `uv run pytest tests/unit/runtime/` → all tests pass; per-package coverage for `sdlc.runtime` ≥ 95%.
  - [ ] Run `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_runtime_import_via_abc_validator.py` → all tests pass.
  - [ ] Run `uv run pytest tests/unit/errors/test_base.py` → all tests pass (including the new `test_mock_miss_error_inherits_dispatch_error_code` test).
  - [ ] Run global `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=90` → passes.
  - [ ] Verify no new modules accidentally got added to coverage `omit` (run `grep -n omit pyproject.toml`); the new files should NOT be on the omit list.
  - [ ] Confirm the smoke fixture is consumed by a real test: `uv run pytest tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_dispatch.py::test_dispatch_hit_returns_fixture_result -v` → passes; if the smoke fixture's hash digest is wrong, this test fails fast.

## Dev Notes

### Why this story exists (FR + NFR + Decision mapping)

- **FR29 — Multi-Agent Specialist Dispatch via runtime-neutral interface (PRD §758-§760)**: this story ships the FIRST and SECOND of the four `runtime/` public symbols declared in Architecture §1062 (`AIRuntime`, `AgentResult`). The Mock (`MockAIRuntime`) is the third. Only `ClaudeAIRuntime` is deferred (Story 2B-1).
- **NFR-COMPAT-3 — Mock-runtime abstraction-adequacy test as CI gate (PRD §855)**: Story 1.14 builds the abstraction-adequacy test ON TOP of this story's MockAIRuntime. Without 1.13, 1.14 has no Mock to wire in. This is a hard substrate dep — 1.14 imports `from sdlc.runtime import MockAIRuntime`.
- **Decision C1 — async dispatch returning `AgentResult`, no streaming (Architecture §355)**: this story is the literal materialization of C1. The forbidden-method check (Task 9) keeps streaming methods out as long as Decision C1 is in force.
- **Decision C2 — deterministic YAML-driven Mock keyed by `(workflow_step, prompt_hash)` (Architecture §356)**: this story is the literal materialization of C2. The fixture format, eager-load semantics, and fail-loud-on-miss all derive from C2.
- **Decision F3 — per-contract schema versioning (Architecture §382)**: `AgentResult` does NOT carry an explicit `schema_version` field in v1 — that's a deliberate departure from the 5 canonical wire-format contracts (`JournalEntry`, `ResumeToken`, `HookPayload`, `SpecialistFrontmatter`, `WorkflowSpec` per Architecture §439). `AgentResult` is an **internal** dispatch return shape, NOT one of the 5 wire-format contracts (which are what gets persisted to disk and shared across the trust boundary). Document this asymmetry in ADR-016 Consequences. Forward-compat: if a future story needs to persist `AgentResult` to disk (e.g. cache the dispatch result for replay), `schema_version: Literal[1] = 1` would be added then.
- **Architecture §1106 — engine/dispatcher import via ABC only**: the existing `boundary-validator` flags `engine → runtime` at module-level (any import is forbidden). The new `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` is the AST-level refinement that allows `from sdlc.runtime import AIRuntime` (the canonical re-export) while still flagging `from sdlc.runtime.mock import ...`. This is the architecture's stated intent; the existing boundary check is too coarse to express it.
- **Architecture §692 + §1012 — fixtures live at `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/`**: the path is canonical. This story creates the directory + a smoke fixture; per-workflow fixtures (`sdlc-epics.yaml`, `sdlc-task.yaml`, etc.) are owned by their workflow stories (2A-9 onwards).

### File set this story creates / modifies

**New files (created):**

- `src/sdlc/runtime/__init__.py` — re-export `AIRuntime, AgentResult, MockAIRuntime, MockMissError`
- `src/sdlc/runtime/abc.py` — `AIRuntime` ABC + `AgentResult` pydantic model (~50-80 LOC)
- `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py` — `MockAIRuntime` + `_Fixture` + `_load_fixtures` + `_hash_prompt` (~150-200 LOC)
- `tests/unit/runtime/__init__.py` — pytest collection sentinel
- `tests/unit/runtime/test_abc.py` — ABC + AgentResult tests (~9 cases)
- `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_loader.py` — mock construction + YAML loading tests (~9 cases)
- `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_dispatch.py` — mock dispatch hit/miss tests (~5 cases)
- `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_determinism.py` — AC3 determinism tests (~3 cases)
- `tests/unit/test_runtime_import_via_abc_validator.py` — linter unit tests (~6 cases)
- `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/engine_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt`
- `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/dispatcher_imports_runtime_claude.py.txt`
- `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/engine_imports_runtime_abc.py.txt`
- `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/cli_imports_runtime_mock.py.txt` (forward-compat fixture; cli/ permissive case test)
- `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/README.md` — fixture format documentation
- `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/_smoke.yaml` — minimal smoke fixture for tests
- `scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py` — AST-level ABC-only import validator (~150-200 LOC)
- `docs/decisions/ADR-016-airuntime-abc-and-mock-implementation.md` — new ADR
- `docs/CODEMAPS/runtime.md` — codemap for runtime/ module (or update if exists)

**Modified files:**

- `src/sdlc/errors/base.py` — append `MockMissError(DispatchError)` class (no new EXIT_CODE_MAP entry)
- `src/sdlc/errors/__init__.py` — add `MockMissError` to imports + `__all__` (semantic order preserved)
- `tests/unit/errors/test_base.py` — add one test for `MockMissError` inheritance
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — add `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` hook between `journal-append-only-validator` and `secret-hardcode-validator`
- `docs/decisions/index.md` — add ADR-016 row (preserving ADR-015 row from Story 1.12)

**Files NOT modified (invariant — break-glass if any of these change):**

- `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py` — `MODULE_DEPS["runtime"]` is already correct from Story 1.4 (`depends_on=frozenset({"errors", "contracts", "concurrency"})`, `forbidden_from=frozenset({"engine", "dispatcher", "state", "journal", "cli"})`). NO edit to MODULE_DEPS by this story.
- `src/sdlc/contracts/*.py` — no new wire-format contract; `AgentResult` is internal to runtime/. Adding it to contracts/ would imply persistent-disk surface, which it isn't in v1.
- `pyproject.toml` — `pyyaml`, `types-PyYAML`, `pytest`, `hypothesis` all present; no new deps. No new ruff/mypy/pytest config (existing markers cover the new tests).
- `src/sdlc/state/*.py`, `src/sdlc/journal/*.py` — runtime/ does NOT import or depend on these. Forward-compat: if a future story needs `MockAIRuntime` to also write to a journal (e.g., for telemetry), that's a bigger change that would touch `MODULE_DEPS["runtime"].depends_on`.

### Why `tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]` (not `list[dict]`)

pydantic v2's `frozen=True` does NOT deep-freeze list members. A `list[dict]` field on a frozen model can still be mutated:

```python
class M(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    items: list[dict] = []
m = M(items=[{"a": 1}])
m.items.append({"b": 2})  # works — mutates the list!
m.items[0]["a"] = 99       # works — mutates the dict!
```

By contrast, `tuple` is immutable at the Python level (no append/extend/__setitem__) and `Mapping[str, object]` is a read-only protocol view (no `__setitem__`). The combination delivers real frozen-ness:

```python
class AgentResult(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...] = ()
r = AgentResult(tool_calls=({"a": 1},))
r.tool_calls.append(...)        # AttributeError — tuple has no append
r.tool_calls[0]["a"] = 99       # the dict CAN still mutate, BUT...
```

The remaining gap (callers can mutate the underlying dict) is acceptable for v1 because `AgentResult` is constructed once per dispatch and not shared across coroutines mutationally. If/when the architecture demands deep immutability, switch to `MappingProxyType`-wrapping like `JournalEntry._freeze_payload` (Story 1.7's `src/sdlc/contracts/journal_entry.py:48`).

### Why eager-load fixtures at construction (not lazy)

Decision C2's stated intent: "missing fixture = fail-loud, abstraction-adequacy CI gate runs full pipeline against mock." A lazy-load implementation would defer malformed-YAML detection until the first dispatch — silently shipping broken fixtures into a CI run that LOOKS like it passed (because the malformed fixture wasn't yet exercised). Eager-load surfaces the failure at `MockAIRuntime(fixtures_dir=...)` construction, which sits at the very top of every test that uses the mock — fail-fast.

Performance: eager-load reads every `*.yaml` under `fixtures_dir`. For Story 1.13 the fixtures count is 1 (the smoke). At Epic 2A (when ~25 specialists × ~10 prompts each are in fixture form), it's ~250 small YAMLs. PyYAML-safe-load on small YAMLs is microseconds each — total construction time < 100ms. Not a concern.

### Why `await asyncio.sleep(0)` in dispatch

A coroutine that never `await`s is observably different from one that does — even if the return value is the same. Consider:

```python
async def fake_dispatch():
    return "result"  # never awaits → schedule-and-finish in one step

async def real_dispatch():
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    return "result"  # awaits once → control yields to the loop, then resumes
```

Under `asyncio.gather(*[fake_dispatch() for _ in range(N)])`, the fakes run sequentially-ish (the loop has no opportunity to interleave). Under `asyncio.gather(*[real_dispatch() for _ in range(N)])`, the loop interleaves coroutines correctly. The dispatcher (Story 2A-3) relies on the abstraction's `await` semantics to bound concurrency via `asyncio.Semaphore` (Decision A2). If `MockAIRuntime.dispatch` never awaits, the abstraction-adequacy test (Story 1.14) would silently mask a class of race-bugs that emerge only under real-Claude dispatch.

The `asyncio.sleep(0)` is a no-op timing-wise (yields control once, immediately re-schedules); it's a correctness fix, not a delay. Document this rationale inline in `mock.py` so a future contributor doesn't "optimize" it away.

### Why `MockMissError(DispatchError)` and not its own class

Architecture §527-§538 lists 8 canonical error classes; Story 1.6 added `IdsError` for a 9th. Adding a 10th (`MockError` or similar) for mock-specific failures would inflate the error surface unnecessarily. The semantic claim:

> Mock dispatch failures are dispatch failures.

The abstraction-adequacy test (Story 1.14) WILL pass through a `MockMissError` and assert `exit_code == 2` — same as a real `DispatchError`. If `MockMissError` had its own `code = "ERR_MOCK"` and a different `exit_code`, the abstraction-adequacy test would have to special-case the mock vs. claude paths, breaking the differential-test pattern.

By inheriting `DispatchError`, the existing `EXIT_CODE_MAP` covers it, the existing dispatch-error catch-blocks see it, and the abstraction is honest: "from the engine's perspective, the runtime failed to dispatch." The mock-specific provenance is in the `details` dict (`step="fixture_lookup"` etc.), not in a new error class.

### Pure function semantics — what the mock IS and IS NOT

**`MockAIRuntime` is allowed to:**

- Read `*.yaml` files at construction time (`Path.read_text` + `yaml.safe_load`).
- Compute `sha256` digests at dispatch time (pure function of input bytes).
- Look up an in-memory `dict[tuple[str, str], _Fixture]`.
- Construct fresh `AgentResult` instances via pydantic model construction.
- `await asyncio.sleep(0)` once per dispatch (yield control to the event loop).

**`MockAIRuntime` is NOT allowed to:**

- Write any file (no `state.json`, no journal, no fixture mutation, no logging output).
- Spawn subprocesses (`subprocess.run`, `os.fork`, etc.).
- Make network calls (`requests`, `urllib`, `httpx`, etc.).
- Mutate module-level state (no `global`, no `nonlocal` write to a captured variable).
- Read environment variables directly (`os.environ` — use `config/env.py` allow-list if needed; v1 mock has no env-var dependency).
- Call `print()` or `logger.*` (Architecture §489 — runtime/ MUST NOT print).
- Have time-dependent behavior (`datetime.now`, `time.time`, `random.*`) — same prompt+context+fixtures must produce the same `AgentResult` regardless of when called.
- Cache the in-memory fixtures `dict` at module-level — `_fixtures` is per-instance state. Two `MockAIRuntime` instances with different `fixtures_dir` MUST NOT share state.

### Previous story intelligence — Stories 1.10 + 1.11 + 1.12

Patterns to mirror exactly (validated through 1.10's 9 patches and 1.11/1.12's review cycles):

- **`from __future__ import annotations`** at top of every new `.py` file.
- **Semantic-order `__all__`** with `# noqa: RUF022` (ruff would otherwise sort alphabetically). See `state/__init__.py` and `journal/__init__.py` for the exact pattern.
- **Cross-platform vs POSIX-only**: `runtime/abc.py` and `runtime/mock.py` are **cross-platform** (no `fcntl`, no `O_APPEND`, no subprocess). NO POSIX gate. Mirror `journal/reader.py` (cross-platform reader). Contrast with `state/atomic.py` and `journal/writer.py` (POSIX-only writers).
- **`Final[...]` constants** for module-level immutables: `_SHA256_PREFIX`, `_KNOWN_KINDS` (n/a here — no kind enum), `_FIXTURE_SUFFIX` (if introduced; v1 doesn't need it). Mirror `state/atomic.py:STATE_FILE_NAME`, `journal/writer.py:JOURNAL_LOCK_SUFFIX`.
- **Narrow exception catches**: `(OSError, yaml.YAMLError)` for fixture-load I/O + parse; `MockMissError` is intentional surface and propagates. Do NOT catch bare `Exception` (Story 1.10 patch lessons).
- **Pure functions for protocol bodies**: `_load_fixtures(fixtures_dir)` and `_hash_prompt(prompt)` are module-level pure functions that the class delegates to. Mirror Story 1.10's `_write_protocol_body` and Story 1.12's `_project_entries`. Easier to test in isolation.
- **Test-seam private functions**: `_load_fixtures`, `_hash_prompt`, `_Fixture` are single-underscore-prefixed, importable for tests, NOT in `__all__`. Mirror Story 1.10's `_canonicalize_state` and Story 1.12's `_project_entries`.
- **Pydantic v2 patterns**: `model_config: ClassVar[ConfigDict] = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", frozen=True, str_strip_whitespace=False)` — same as `JournalEntry`, `HookPayload`, `SpecialistFrontmatter`. `Field(default_factory=tuple)` for tuple defaults; `Field(ge=0)` for non-negative ints.
- **mypy `--strict`**: no `Any` leaks. Use `Mapping[str, object]`, `tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]`, `dict[tuple[str, str], _Fixture]`, `Final[str]`. Run `uv run mypy --strict src/sdlc/runtime/` BEFORE committing.
- **Fixture file convention**: negative-test fixtures at `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/*.py.txt` (NOT `.py` — fixtures are text files so they don't get collected by pytest or scanned by ruff/mypy). Mirror Stories 1.10 + 1.11.
- **Scripts mirror existing validators**: `scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py` MUST mirror the structure of `scripts/check_no_journal_mutation.py` (Story 1.11): function-style AST visitor, exit codes 0/1, message format `<path>:<line>: <human-readable-violation>`. Run-from-pre-commit semantics: receives file paths as argv; exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations.

Code-review feedback from Stories 1.10 + 1.11 + 1.12 to pre-empt:

- Be explicit about exception chaining (`raise MockMissError(...) from exc` where the underlying `OSError` / `yaml.YAMLError` is re-raised — preserves the original traceback for debugging).
- Avoid `Any` in type hints — `Mapping[str, object]` is the canonical narrow form. The `_Fixture.tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]` is type-safe AND frozen.
- Verify `mypy --strict` passes BEFORE committing. The strict config in `pyproject.toml:108` will reject untyped functions, missing returns, and Any leaks.
- Use access-mode check pattern where relevant (n/a here — no fd manipulation in runtime/).
- Narrow exception catches; do NOT swallow programmer errors.
- For coverage: hit ≥ 95% per-file. The mock has multiple branches (fixtures-dir error, YAML parse error, shape error, key error, hit, miss); each needs at least one test.
- For the linter validator: mirror the AST visitor pattern; positive + negative fixtures; line-number assertions in violation messages.

```

**Notable**: Stories 1.11 and 1.12 have NOT been committed yet (1.11 is `in-progress`, 1.12 is `ready-for-dev` per sprint-status.yaml). The `src/sdlc/journal/`, `src/sdlc/state/projection.py`, `tests/property/test_journal_append_only.py`, and ADRs 014-015 may exist on disk but are uncommitted.

**Story 1.13 work depends on these uncommitted files only at the boundary level** — `runtime/__init__.py` does NOT import `from sdlc.state import ...` or `from sdlc.journal import ...`. The runtime module is decoupled from state/journal at the import level. **However**, the test scaffolding under `tests/unit/runtime/test_mock_*.py` imports `from sdlc.errors import MockMissError` (this story's deliverable) and `from sdlc.runtime import MockAIRuntime` (this story's deliverable). Self-contained.

If 1.11/1.12 are reverted before 1.13 ships, this story does NOT break — it's substrate-independent of the journal/state work.

**Commit pattern to follow** (Story 1.10/1.11/1.12 precedent):

- One `feat: implement AIRuntime ABC + MockAIRuntime (Story 1.13)` commit covering: `src/sdlc/runtime/`, `src/sdlc/errors/base.py` edit, `src/sdlc/errors/__init__.py` edit, `tests/unit/runtime/`, `tests/unit/errors/test_base.py` edit, `tests/unit/test_runtime_import_via_abc_validator.py`, `tests/fixtures/lint_negative/runtime_*.py.txt`, `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/`, `scripts/check_runtime_import_via_abc.py`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` edit, `docs/decisions/ADR-016-*.md`, `docs/decisions/index.md` edit, `docs/CODEMAPS/runtime.md`.
- Apply review patches in a follow-up `fix:` commit if needed (Story 1.8/1.10/1.11 precedent).

### Latest tech information

- **Python 3.10+** target (`pyproject.toml:10`). All language features used (`Mapping[str, object]`, `tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]`, `dict[tuple[str, str], _Fixture]`, `Final[str]`, abstract method async) are stable in 3.10.
- **pydantic v2** (Story 1.7+ on disk at `src/sdlc/contracts/`). `model_config: ClassVar[ConfigDict] = ConfigDict(...)` is the canonical v2 form. `Field(ge=0)` enforces non-negative ints. `model_dump(mode="json")` for canonical serialization. `model_validate(record)` constructs from a parsed YAML mapping. `extra="forbid"` rejects unknown keys (canary for fixture-schema drift).
- **PyYAML 6.x** (`pyproject.toml:13`). `yaml.safe_load(text)` parses to plain Python types (`dict`, `list`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`). NEVER `yaml.load` or `yaml.full_load` (allow `__reduce__`-based RCE). PyYAML errors are subclasses of `yaml.YAMLError` → catch this, not bare `Exception`.
- **`hashlib.sha256`** (stdlib, Python 3.10+). Returns a `_hashlib.HASH` object; `.hexdigest()` returns 64-char lowercase hex. Stable across Python versions and across runs (NOT randomized like `hash()`). Determinism is OS-independent.
- **`asyncio.sleep(0)`** (stdlib, Python 3.10+). Yields control once to the event loop; equivalent to `await asyncio.shield(asyncio.sleep(0))` in semantics but lighter. The cancellation point matters for the abstraction-adequacy test (Story 1.14).
- **`abc.ABC` + `@abstractmethod`** (stdlib). `AIRuntime(ABC)` makes the class abstract; `@abstractmethod` on `dispatch` makes instantiation fail with `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class ...`. Subclasses MUST implement all abstract methods or they themselves become abstract.
- **`pytest`** (`pyproject.toml:24`). The project uses `markers = ["unit", "integration", "property", "chaos", "benchmark", "e2e"]` per `pyproject.toml:177-183`. New tests use `unit` (most cases) or `integration` (subprocess-based hash stability test).
- **`asyncio.run(coro)`**: pytest does NOT have `pytest-asyncio` configured (`pyproject.toml:21-31` dev-deps list). Use `asyncio.run(mock.dispatch(...))` directly inside sync test functions. This is the project-wide pattern; do NOT add `pytest-asyncio` for this story (unnecessary new dep).

### Project Structure Notes

- **Alignment with unified project structure**: this story creates `src/sdlc/runtime/{__init__,abc,mock}.py` per Architecture §826-§829. The full architecture lists three files for `runtime/`: `abc.py`, `claude.py`, `mock.py`. Story 1.13 ships `abc.py`, `mock.py`, `__init__.py`; `claude.py` is deferred to Story 2B-1. Tests are mirrored from `src/sdlc/runtime/` to `tests/unit/runtime/` per the canonical "tests/unit/ mirrors src/sdlc/" structure (Architecture §983-§995).
- **No conflict with architecture**: every file path in Task 1's "New files" list lives under a directory the architecture has already declared. Fixture path `tests/fixtures/mock_responses/` matches Architecture §692 + §1012 exactly.
- **Pyproject markers**: `unit`, `integration` already exist. No new marks needed.
- **CI workflow**: NO new CI job — runtime/ tests run as part of the existing `unit` job; the subprocess-based hash test runs as part of the existing `integration` job. The new `runtime-import-via-abc-validator` runs as part of pre-commit + CI's existing pre-commit step.
- **Runtime module reservation**: this story takes `runtime/` from "empty / planned" to "abc + mock + __init__ shipped". The `forbidden_from` in MODULE_DEPS is already declared (Story 1.4) — no MODULE_DEPS update from this story.

### Why deferred from this story

These are explicitly NOT in scope for Story 1.13 — flag if they creep in during implementation:

- **`runtime/claude.py` (`ClaudeAIRuntime`)** — Story 2B-1. Subprocess management, edge cases, malformed JSON, timeout handling. The ABC must be in place first; this story builds the ABC.
- **Abstraction-adequacy CI test (`tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py`)** — Story 1.14. Runs the full pipeline (init → scan → dispatch → state projection → journal append) against MockAIRuntime; asserts deterministic HookPayload sequence. Story 1.13 ships the substrate; 1.14 ships the integration.
- **`AgentResult` schema versioning** — `AgentResult` is internal to runtime/, not one of the 5 wire-format contracts. Forward-compat: if a future story persists `AgentResult` to disk, add `schema_version: Literal[1] = 1` then.
- **Per-workflow YAML fixtures (`sdlc-epics.yaml`, `sdlc-task.yaml`, etc.)** — owned by their respective workflow stories (Stories 2A-9 onwards). Story 1.13 ships the SHAPE + a smoke fixture only.
- **Real prompt construction** — building the prompts that get hashed is the dispatcher's job (Story 2A-3). Story 1.13 only defines the dispatch interface; what gets dispatched is downstream.
- **Tool-call validation** — `tool_calls: tuple[Mapping[str, object], ...]` accepts any mapping shape. Phase-gate hook (Story 2A-4) validates that tool-call write_globs are within the agent's declared frontmatter; that's separate from the dispatch return-shape.
- **Streaming dispatch** — Decision C1 + Architecture §327 explicitly defer. If a v1.x story needs streaming, the ABC will gain a new optional method (NOT make `dispatch` itself streaming — that would be a breaking change to existing implementations).
- **Token-budget enforcement** — `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` are reported on `AgentResult` but no enforcement happens in v1. Token-budget caps live in the dispatcher (Story 2A-3) and are configured via `pyproject.toml [tool.sdlc.runtime]` (deferred to a config story).
- **Concurrent fixture loading** — `_load_fixtures` is single-threaded eager-load. Multiple `MockAIRuntime` instances with the same `fixtures_dir` will each parse YAML independently. That's fine for v1 (fixtures count is small); a future story can introduce a process-wide cache if measured to matter.
- **Mock-vs-claude differential test** — Story 2B-3. Uses both `MockAIRuntime` and `ClaudeAIRuntime` and asserts identical HookPayload event sequences. Story 1.13 ships only the Mock; 2B-3 adds the second variant.
- **HookPayload integration** — Story 1.13's mock returns `AgentResult` only. The Claude PreToolUse / engine-side hook chain that converts an agent's tool-calls into `HookPayload` events lives in Story 2A-4 + 2A-6. Out of scope here.
- **Workflow-step schema** — `context["workflow_step"]: str` is loosely typed in v1. A future story may formalize it (e.g. `WorkflowStep` Literal type listing all 17 valid slash-command names). Forward-compat: the mock today accepts any string, including unknown ones (which simply produce a fixture-miss); narrowing is additive, not breaking.
