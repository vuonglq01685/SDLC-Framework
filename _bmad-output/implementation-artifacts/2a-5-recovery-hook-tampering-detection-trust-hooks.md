# Story 2A.5: [Recovery] Hook Tampering Detection + `sdlc trust-hooks`

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user trusting the hook chain,
I want hook tampering detection on every `sdlc init` and `sdlc scan` (compare current hook file hashes against `.claude/state/hook-hashes.json`), with an explicit `sdlc trust-hooks` CLI to re-record hashes after intentional change,
So that hook modifications surface a warning until acknowledged (FR39, NFR-SEC-5), and a missing/corrupted hash store fails advisory-loud (no silent skip) until trust is re-established.

## Acceptance Criteria

> Source ACs: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md:1090-1113`. Per ADR-026 §1, the public CLI surface (`sdlc trust-hooks`, the warning emitted by `sdlc scan`) requires TDD-first commit ordering. The `hook-hashes.json` file format is a **new internal artifact** (NOT a wire-format contract — see ADR-024 + AC8 below for explicit non-snapshot policy).

### AC1 — Hash store schema (`hook-hashes.json` internal artifact)

**Given** the hash store at `<state_root>/hook-hashes.json` (where `<state_root>` is `.claude/state/` per Story 1.16 + Story 2A.0 P26 amendment — NOT `.sdlc/state/`)
**When** the dev defines the file format
**Then** the file conforms to this canonical JSON shape (one canonical newline-terminated line per the existing atomic-write protocol):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "trusted_at": "<RFC 3339 UTC, ms precision, Z suffix>",
  "hooks_root": ".claude/hooks",
  "hashes": {
    "<relpath under hooks_root>": "sha256:<64 hex chars>"
  }
}
```

**And** keys in `hashes` are sorted lexicographically for byte-stable round-trip
**And** the loader/parser/writer lives at `src/sdlc/hooks/tampering.py` (Architecture §863 mandates this filename); the model is a private pydantic `_HookHashStore` inheriting `StrictModel` (NOT a wire-format contract; see AC8)
**And** the file is written via the existing atomic-write protocol from `src/sdlc/state/atomic.py` (tmp + rename + flock + fsync — Story 1.10) — do NOT roll a separate writer

### AC2 — `compute_hook_hashes(hooks_root: Path) -> dict[str, str]`

**Given** the hooks tree at `<hooks_root>` (default `.claude/hooks/`)
**When** the dev calls `hooks.tampering.compute_hook_hashes(hooks_root)`
**Then** the function:
  1. Walks `hooks_root.rglob("*.py")` in `sorted` order (POSIX path semantics — use `pathlib.PurePosixPath` for relpath construction so the result is byte-identical on Linux/macOS/Windows)
  2. Computes `sha256` of each file's bytes-on-disk (NOT canonicalized; raw bytes — hooks are Python source files, not JSON)
  3. Returns `dict[str, str]` keyed by relpath-from-hooks_root, value `f"sha256:{hexdigest}"`
**And** symlinks are followed by default — but a symlink leaving `hooks_root` raises `HookError("hook symlink escapes hooks_root: <relpath> → <target>")` (security: prevents `.claude/hooks/x.py → /etc/passwd`-style attacks)
**And** if `hooks_root` does not exist, raises `HookError("hooks_root not found: <path>; run 'sdlc init' first")`
**And** non-`.py` files in `hooks_root` are silently ignored (matches the architecture §971-§974 reality that only `.py` files are installed hooks)

### AC3 — `record_trust(state_root: Path, hashes: dict[str, str], *, now_utc: str) -> None`

**Given** a computed hash dict + a state directory
**When** the dev calls `hooks.tampering.record_trust(state_root, hashes, now_utc=...)`
**Then** the function writes `<state_root>/hook-hashes.json` atomically via `state.atomic.write_atomic` (or whichever public function the existing module exposes — verify against `src/sdlc/state/atomic.py`)
**And** `now_utc` is dependency-injected (test reproducibility); production callers pass `_now_rfc3339_utc()` from `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py:39` (or its public sibling — copy the timestamp shape verbatim)
**And** any I/O failure surfaces as `HookError` wrapping the underlying `OSError`/`StateError`
**And** on success, journal an entry per AC6 — but the journal write is the CLI command's responsibility, NOT this module's (boundary discipline: `hooks/` does not import `journal/`; CLI orchestrates)

### AC4 — `detect_tampering(state_root, hooks_root) -> TamperReport`

**Given** the hash store may be present, missing, or corrupted
**When** the dev calls `hooks.tampering.detect_tampering(state_root, hooks_root)`
**Then** the function returns a `TamperReport` `@dataclass(frozen=True)`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TamperReport:
    status: Literal["clean", "tampered", "uninitialized", "corrupted"]
    expected: Mapping[str, str]      # hashes from store; empty for uninitialized/corrupted
    actual: Mapping[str, str]        # current hashes
    drift: tuple[HookDrift, ...]     # populated only when status == "tampered"
    message: str                     # human-readable summary

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HookDrift:
    relpath: str
    expected: str | None             # None = added since trust
    actual: str | None               # None = removed since trust
    kind: Literal["added", "removed", "modified"]
```

**And** status semantics:
  - `clean` → store exists, parses, hashes match
  - `tampered` → store exists, parses, but at least one hash differs / file added / file removed
  - `uninitialized` → store does not exist
  - `corrupted` → store exists but fails `_HookHashStore` validation OR fails JSON parse
**And** the function NEVER raises on store-not-found or store-corrupt (these are *report states*, not exceptions); it raises `HookError` only for unrecoverable I/O (e.g. permission denied on the directory)
**And** for `tampered` status, `drift` is sorted by `relpath` (byte-stable diagnostic output)

### AC5 — Warning rendering on `sdlc scan` (FR39, NFR-SEC-5 advisory)

**Given** `sdlc scan` runs and `detect_tampering` returns a non-`clean` status
**When** the CLI renders output
**Then** the warning shape is:

- **`tampered`:**
  ```
  [WARN] hook tampering detected: <N> file(s) changed since trust.
    modified: .claude/hooks/<relpath>
      expected: sha256:<short8>...
      actual:   sha256:<short8>...
    added:    .claude/hooks/<relpath>
    removed:  .claude/hooks/<relpath>
  Run 'sdlc trust-hooks' to acknowledge or restore the file(s).
  ```

- **`uninitialized`:**
  ```
  [WARN] hook hashes unavailable; run 'sdlc trust-hooks' to initialize.
  ```

- **`corrupted`:**
  ```
  [WARN] hook hash store at <path> is corrupted: <reason>; run 'sdlc trust-hooks' to re-initialize.
  ```

**And** the warning goes to **stderr** (NOT stdout) — `sdlc scan`'s stdout is the structured scan summary; stderr is the human advisory channel (mirrors existing `_logger.warning` pattern at `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py:50`)
**And** the warnings are advisory-only in v1: `sdlc scan` exits 0 even when the report is non-clean — graduating to hard-block is explicitly out of scope (PRD §374 + ADR-013 v1 advisory-only posture)
**And** **escape hatch on uninitialized/corrupted:** when status ∈ {`uninitialized`, `corrupted`}, the framework refuses any *hook-bypass* operation until trust is re-established (this is the AC3 third-Given of the source spec; the bypass refusal is enforced in Story 2A.4 pre-write hook chain — 2A.5 surfaces only the warning + exposes a `trust_state: TamperStatus` field on the scan output that 2A.4 reads)

### AC6 — `sdlc trust-hooks` CLI command

**Given** the user runs `sdlc trust-hooks` from anywhere in a repo with `.claude/state/`
**When** the command executes
**Then** the command:
  1. Resolves repo root via the existing `cli/_paths.get_repo_root_or_cwd()` helper
  2. Refuses to run if `.claude/` is missing — exits non-zero with `[ERROR] not an sdlc workspace; run 'sdlc init' first` to stderr
  3. Calls `compute_hook_hashes(repo_root / ".claude/hooks")`
  4. Calls `record_trust(repo_root / ".claude/state", hashes, now_utc=...)`
  5. Appends ONE journal entry with `kind="hooks_trusted"`, `payload={"files": <sorted list of relpaths>}`, `target_id="hook-hashes"`, `before_hash=<sha256 of prior store or null>`, `after_hash=<sha256 of new store>` — uses the existing journal writer at `src/sdlc/journal/writer.py` (do NOT roll a separate writer)
  6. Emits stdout `[OK] hook hashes recorded: <N> file(s) at <RFC 3339 UTC>`
  7. Exits 0
**And** the command supports `--json` per CLI Output Conventions (Architecture §674-§680); the JSON envelope mirrors the existing scan/status `--json` shape (verify against `src/sdlc/cli/output.py`)
**And** the command lives at `src/sdlc/cli/trust_hooks.py` (Architecture §806 mandates this filename)
**And** the command is wired into the Typer app at `src/sdlc/cli/main.py` (or whichever module is canonical — verify against `src/sdlc/cli/__init__.py`)
**And** the journal `kind="hooks_trusted"` is a NEW kind value — extend the kind enum/literal in `src/sdlc/contracts/journal_entry.py` IF AND ONLY IF the contract treats `kind` as a closed Literal; if it's an open `str`, no contract edit is required (verify against the contract; do NOT edit the contract speculatively per ADR-024 v1 lock)

### AC7 — Integration with `sdlc init` and `sdlc scan`

**Given** the existing `sdlc init` and `sdlc scan` commands (Story 1.16 + Story 1.17)
**When** the dev integrates 2A.5
**Then** `sdlc init` (Story 1.16):
  - After installing `package_data/claude_hooks/*.py` into `.claude/hooks/` (or whatever is the existing `init` step) — call `compute_hook_hashes` and `record_trust` to baseline the hash store
  - The init journal stream gains a `kind="hooks_trusted"` entry with `payload={"files": [...], "via": "sdlc init"}` (the `via` discriminator distinguishes init-baselining from explicit `trust-hooks`)
**And** `sdlc scan` (Story 1.17):
  - Calls `detect_tampering` after the existing scan body
  - If status ≠ `clean`, emits the AC5 warning to stderr; sets `trust_state` on the scan output
  - `sdlc scan --json` includes `trust_state: {"status": "<status>", "drift_count": <N>}` in the JSON envelope
**And** the existing `walking_skeleton` Tier-1 e2e scenario (Story 2A.0) MUST still pass — meaning the new init + scan paths are byte-stable on the existing goldens. **If the goldens change because of the new `trust_state` field**, regenerate via `pytest --update-goldens` and explain the change in the PR Change Log per Story 2A.0 AC7's "drift via --update-goldens requires explanation" rule
**And** if regenerating walking_skeleton goldens is required, ALSO update `tests/e2e/cli/fixtures/walking_skeleton/README.md` to describe the new `trust_state` field

### AC8 — `_HookHashStore` is NOT a wire-format contract

**Given** the wire-format v1 lock (ADR-024) freezes 5 contracts at `tests/contract_snapshots/v1/`
**When** the dev introduces `_HookHashStore`
**Then** the model is **private to `hooks/tampering.py`** (underscore-prefix); it is NOT exported from `sdlc.contracts`; it does NOT add a snapshot file under `tests/contract_snapshots/v1/`
**And** the module docstring of `tampering.py` explicitly states: `"_HookHashStore is internal policy state, not a wire-format contract. Format may evolve in v1.x without ADR-024 ceremony."`
**And** `python scripts/freeze_wireformat_snapshots.py --check` reports `5 contracts match snapshots` (unchanged from current state)

### AC9 — Errors hierarchy: extend `HookError` (no new class)

**Given** the existing error hierarchy at `src/sdlc/errors/base.py:53` already defines `class HookError(SdlcError)` (predates this story)
**When** the dev needs to surface tampering / I/O / symlink-escape errors
**Then** the dev raises `HookError(...)` directly with `details={"step": "...", "path": "..."}` shape (mirroring `MockMissError` from Story 1.13)
**And** NO new error class is added in 2A.5 (Stories 2A.1 added `WorkflowError`; Story 2A.2 adds `SpecialistError`; 2A.5 reuses the existing `HookError`)
**And** if a new tampering-specific error class becomes necessary post-implementation, add it as a subclass of `HookError` (NOT of `SdlcError`); document via D1/D2/D3 protocol in the PR Change Log

### AC10 — Module boundaries (Architecture §1056-§1071, §1109)

**Given** the architectural boundaries: `hooks/` may import `errors/`, `contracts/`, `state/`, `journal/`, `ids/` per Architecture §1065. **However**, boundary rule §5 (Architecture §1109) states: *"`hooks/` does not import `engine/` or `dispatcher/`."* Note: `tampering.py` does not need `state/` or `journal/` — those live in CLI orchestration.
**When** the dev runs the boundary linter
**Then** `src/sdlc/hooks/tampering.py` imports only `errors`, `contracts._strict_model`, and stdlib (`hashlib`, `pathlib`, `json`, `typing`); it does NOT import `state`, `journal`, `cli`, `engine`, `dispatcher`, `runtime`, `workflows`, `specialists`, `dashboard`, `adopt`, `config`
**And** `src/sdlc/cli/trust_hooks.py` is allowed to import `hooks.tampering`, `state.atomic`, `journal.writer`, `cli._paths`, `cli.output`, `errors`, `contracts` (CLI is the orchestration layer)
**And** the linter emits zero new violations after this story's diff

### AC11 — Tier-1 e2e scenario for hook trust (NEW scenario, optional but recommended)

**Given** the Tier-1 harness from Story 2A.0
**When** the dev considers adding a Tier-1 scenario covering trust-hooks
**Then** ONE of the following is delivered (D1/D2/D3 per ADR-026 §3):
  - **D1:** Add a NEW Tier-1 scenario `tests/e2e/cli/fixtures/hook_trust/` exercising `init → trust-hooks → modify-hook → scan (warning) → trust-hooks → scan (clean)`. Adds 5 commands × 5 golden files = 25 new goldens.
  - **D2:** Add ONLY the `init → scan-clean` path to the existing `walking_skeleton` scenario (covers AC7 happy-path baseline only). Defer the modify→scan-warn→trust→scan-clean cycle to a follow-up story.
  - **D3:** Defer all new e2e coverage to a follow-up story; rely on integration tests under `tests/integration/test_hook_tampering.py`.
**And** whichever option is chosen, the choice MUST be the FIRST line item in the PR's "Change log" section: `D-decision: AC11 chose D<n> because <one-line reason>`
**And** if D1 is chosen, the scenario fixture's `commands.yaml` MUST mark the modify-hook step as `os_marker: posix` if it uses `chmod`/symlink/POSIX-only behavior (Story 2A.0 AC5.4 pattern; mirror the `_SKIP_NO_UV` + `_SKIP_WIN32` skip-marker shape from Story 1.16)

### AC12 — Quality gate compliance (CONTRIBUTING.md §1)

**Given** the full Day-1 quality gate
**When** the dev runs the gate locally before requesting `review-A`
**Then** all of the following pass:
  - `ruff format --check && ruff check src tests`
  - `mypy --strict src tests`
  - `pytest -q -m "not e2e"` (unit + integration + property + contract tests green)
  - `pytest -q -m e2e` (Tier-1 + Tier-2 still green; 2A.0 walking_skeleton MUST pass — golden regen if AC7 forces it)
  - `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90` (≥ 90% repo-wide; module-level expectation: 100% on `hooks/tampering.py` — pure logic; CLI command 100% line + branch as far as integration test coverage permits)
  - `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - `mkdocs build --strict`
  - `python scripts/freeze_wireformat_snapshots.py --check` — MUST still report `5 contracts match snapshots` per AC8

## Tasks / Subtasks

> Tasks ordered to enable TDD-first commits per ADR-026 §1.

- [ ] **Task 1 — `compute_hook_hashes` + `_HookHashStore` model (AC1, AC2)** — **TDD-first commit 1**
  - [ ] 1.1 Author `tests/unit/hooks/test_tampering_compute.py` covering: empty hooks_root; one-file tree; multi-file tree with sorted relpath order; symlink-following inside tree; symlink-escape raises `HookError`; missing `hooks_root` raises `HookError`; non-`.py` files ignored. Fixture trees under `tests/fixtures/hooks/trees/{empty,single,multi,symlink_internal,symlink_escape,with_non_py}/`. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 1.2 Author `tests/unit/hooks/test_hash_store_model.py` covering: `_HookHashStore.model_validate` happy path; bad `schema_version` reject; bad `hashes` value (not `sha256:...`) reject; round-trip via `model_dump_json` is byte-stable. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement `src/sdlc/hooks/__init__.py` (re-export public names), `src/sdlc/hooks/tampering.py` with `_HookHashStore` (private, `StrictModel`), `_HOOK_GLOB = "**/*.py"`, `compute_hook_hashes(hooks_root: Path) -> dict[str, str]`. Use stdlib only. Tests pass (green).
  - [ ] 1.4 LOC cap: keep `tampering.py` ≤ 250 LOC.

- [ ] **Task 2 — `record_trust` + atomic write integration (AC3)**
  - [ ] 2.1 Author `tests/unit/hooks/test_record_trust.py` covering: writes the file at the right path; round-trip parses to same `_HookHashStore`; second write overwrites first; failure mid-write does not corrupt the file (tmp+rename atomicity verified by injecting a write-fail mock). Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement `record_trust(state_root: Path, hashes: dict[str, str], *, now_utc: str) -> None`. Use `state.atomic.write_atomic` (verify the public function name; if it differs, cite the deviation in the PR Change Log per D-decision protocol). Tests pass (green).

- [ ] **Task 3 — `detect_tampering` + `TamperReport` (AC4)**
  - [ ] 3.1 Author `tests/unit/hooks/test_detect_tampering.py` covering: clean (everything matches); tampered (one modified, one added, one removed → 3-element drift sorted by relpath); uninitialized (no store); corrupted (store exists but bad JSON; store exists but fails pydantic validation). Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement `TamperReport` and `HookDrift` `@dataclass(frozen=True)` and `detect_tampering(state_root: Path, hooks_root: Path) -> TamperReport`. Tests pass (green).
  - [ ] 3.3 **Anti-tautology receipt** (per Story 2A.0 AC6 pattern): manually break the drift-detection logic (e.g., remove the `removed` branch) and confirm the corresponding test fires. Document the receipt in the PR Change Log: `"Manually verified TamperReport.drift by [removed branch / sort order swap / corrupted-vs-uninitialized swap] — tests failed as expected."`

- [ ] **Task 4 — Warning rendering helper (AC5)**
  - [ ] 4.1 Author `tests/unit/hooks/test_render_warning.py` covering: `tampered` shape with N=1, N=3 (modified+added+removed); `uninitialized` shape; `corrupted` shape. Use snapshot-style golden assertions on the rendered string. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement `render_warning(report: TamperReport) -> str` in `src/sdlc/hooks/tampering.py`. Pure function — returns the human-readable string; the CLI is responsible for routing to stderr. Tests pass (green).

- [ ] **Task 5 — `sdlc trust-hooks` CLI command (AC6)**
  - [ ] 5.1 Author `tests/integration/test_trust_hooks_cmd.py` covering: not-an-sdlc-workspace exits non-zero with stderr message; happy path baseline (no prior store) writes the store + journals + emits `[OK]`; happy path re-trust (prior store exists) overwrites + journals; `--json` envelope shape. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement `src/sdlc/cli/trust_hooks.py`. Wire into Typer app. Tests pass (green).
  - [ ] 5.3 LOC cap: keep `cli/trust_hooks.py` ≤ 200 LOC.
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify journal `kind="hooks_trusted"` works against the existing `JournalEntry` contract; if `kind` is a closed Literal, document the contract edit need explicitly via D-decision (DO NOT silently amend the contract — ADR-024 lock).

- [ ] **Task 6 — Integration into `sdlc init` (AC7 first half)**
  - [ ] 6.1 Author `tests/integration/test_init_baselines_hooks.py` asserting that after `sdlc init` the hash store exists at `.claude/state/hook-hashes.json`, parses to a non-empty `_HookHashStore`, and the journal has one `kind="hooks_trusted"` entry with `via="sdlc init"`. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 6.2 Add a single call site in `src/sdlc/cli/init.py` after the existing hook installation step. Tests pass (green).
  - [ ] 6.3 Run `pytest tests/e2e/ -q -m e2e` to verify Tier-1 walking_skeleton goldens; if they drift, regenerate per AC7 + Story 2A.0 AC7 procedure and explain in PR Change Log.

- [ ] **Task 7 — Integration into `sdlc scan` (AC7 second half)**
  - [ ] 7.1 Author `tests/integration/test_scan_warns_on_tamper.py` covering: clean → no warning, exit 0; tampered → warning to stderr, exit 0, `--json` includes `trust_state`; uninitialized → warning, exit 0; corrupted → warning, exit 0. Tests fail (red).
  - [ ] 7.2 Add `detect_tampering` + `render_warning` calls to `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py`. Add `trust_state` to the scan output schema. Tests pass (green).
  - [ ] 7.3 Run `pytest tests/e2e/ -q -m e2e` again; explain any walking_skeleton golden regen.

- [ ] **Task 8 — Tier-1 e2e D-decision (AC11)**
  - [ ] 8.1 Pick D1/D2/D3. Document in PR body before opening review-A label.
  - [ ] 8.2 If D1: build `tests/e2e/cli/fixtures/hook_trust/` per AC11 spec. If D2: extend walking_skeleton minimally. If D3: add debt entry to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md`.

- [ ] **Task 9 — Module-boundary linter (AC10)**
  - [ ] 9.1 Confirm `hooks/` is already in the layered table (predates this story). Verify `tampering.py` imports stay within allowed set. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to confirm zero new violations.

- [ ] **Task 10 — Quality gate full sweep (AC12)**
  - [ ] 10.1 `ruff format --check && ruff check src tests`
  - [ ] 10.2 `mypy --strict src tests`
  - [ ] 10.3 `pytest -q -m "not e2e" && pytest -q -m e2e`
  - [ ] 10.4 `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90`
  - [ ] 10.5 `pre-commit run --all-files`

- [ ] **Task 11 — Docs + change log**
  - [ ] 11.1 Update `docs/runbooks/handle-hash-drift.md` (or create) with the operator-facing procedure: detect → inspect drift → either restore file OR run `sdlc trust-hooks`. Cite NFR-SEC-5 advisory-only posture explicitly.
  - [ ] 11.2 PR body per CONTRIBUTING.md §6 template; first line of Change Log MUST be `D-decision: AC11 chose D<n> because <reason>` (and AC6 contract-edit decision if applicable).

## Dev Notes

### Critical context — DO NOT skip

Story 2A.5 is the **recovery slice** for hook trust at Layer 1 of Epic 2A's DAG (`docs/sprints/epic-2a-dag.md:107-122`). It is mostly **independent of 2A.1 + 2A.2 at the source-tree level**, but it has a **non-obvious coupling to Story 2A.0**: any change to `sdlc init` or `sdlc scan` output regenerates the Tier-1 walking_skeleton goldens. Three rules:

1. **Advisory-only in v1, hard-block in v1.x.** PRD §374 + ADR-013 lock the v1 trust posture as advisory. Do NOT add an exit-non-zero path on tampered status without rewriting the PRD — that's a v1.x scope. The "refuse hook bypass" escape hatch (AC5 third-Given) is enforced in Story 2A.4, NOT here; 2A.5 only surfaces the warning + exposes `trust_state` for 2A.4 to consume.
2. **`_HookHashStore` is NOT a wire-format contract.** AC8 makes this explicit. The file format may evolve in v1.x without an ADR-024 mutation ceremony. If you find yourself writing `tests/contract_snapshots/v1/hook_hash_store.json`, **stop**.
3. **Journal `kind="hooks_trusted"` is the integration tripwire.** Verify the `JournalEntry` contract before adding the new kind value. If `kind` is a closed `Literal[...]`, the contract edit needs an ADR-024 ceremony — flag it via D-decision protocol and DEFER the integration to a follow-up if the ceremony hasn't run. If `kind` is open `str`, no ceremony needed.

### What this story IS NOT

- It is NOT the pre-write hook chain (that arrives in **Story 2A.4**, which depends on 2A.5's `trust_state` for the bypass-refusal escape hatch).
- It is NOT the Claude Code PreToolUse hook (that arrives in **Story 2A.6**, depending on 2A.4).
- It is NOT phase-gate enforcement (Story 2A.4) or hash-drift on signoffs (Story 2A.7) — those are sibling but separate hash-validation surfaces.
- It does NOT graduate to hard-block on tampering (v1.x scope per PRD §374).
- It does NOT enforce trust on `claude_hooks/` (the *Claude-Code-side* PreToolUse hook live at `src/sdlc/claude_hooks/` per Architecture §971-§974); 2A.5 covers ONLY `.claude/hooks/` (the **engine-side** hooks tree).

### Architecture compliance

- **Module specifications (Architecture §1065).** `hooks/` exposes `HookPayload`, `run_hook_chain`, `detect_tampering`, builtin hooks. Imports: `errors`, `contracts`, `state`, `journal`, `ids`. **However**, `tampering.py` itself only imports `errors` + `contracts._strict_model` + stdlib — the `state/journal/ids` dependencies are downstream consumers (CLI orchestration). AC10 is the linter enforcement.
- **Boundary rule §5 (Architecture §1109).** *"`hooks/` does not import `engine/` or `dispatcher/`."* — already satisfied by 2A.5's design.
- **Atomic write protocol (Architecture §569-§589).** All writes to `hook-hashes.json` go through `state.atomic.write_atomic` (Story 1.10). Do NOT roll a separate writer.
- **JSON canonicalization (Architecture §496-§515, Pattern §3).** The hash store is canonical JSON: sorted keys, ms-precision UTC, terminating newline. Use the same canonicalization helper that `state/atomic.py` and `journal/writer.py` use.
- **Pydantic strict-mode (ADR-025).** `_HookHashStore` inherits `StrictModel`. `model_validate(...)` calls pass `strict=True`.
- **Wire-format v1 lock (ADR-024).** `_HookHashStore` is private; AC8 verifies the snapshot count stays at 5.
- **Cold-start budget (Architecture §488-§494).** `compute_hook_hashes` adds: 1× directory walk + N × `sha256` of small files (~1KB each). With ≤ 10 hooks, total < 10ms. Negligible vs the existing 200ms cold-start floor.

### Library / framework requirements

- **`hashlib` (stdlib)** for sha256 — already used by `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py:_compute_prompt_hash`.
- **`pathlib` (stdlib)** for filesystem traversal.
- **`json` (stdlib)** for serialization — but the writer goes through `state.atomic.write_atomic` which handles canonicalization.
- **pydantic** ≥ 2.x for `_HookHashStore` (already pinned).
- **No new runtime dependencies introduced.** Specifically: do NOT add `watchdog` or any filesystem-event library — 2A.5 is detection-on-demand, not continuous monitoring.
- **Python ≥ 3.10** per `.python-version`; `from __future__ import annotations` consistently.

Mirrors:
- `src/sdlc/state/atomic.py` — atomic-write protocol (Story 1.10); reuse via the public function.
- `src/sdlc/journal/writer.py` — journal append; reuse via the public function.
- `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py:31-48` — sha256 + RFC 3339 helpers; copy the timestamp shape verbatim.
- `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py:_compute_prompt_hash` — sha256 hex pattern; mirror the `sha256:<hex>` prefix convention.

### Testing requirements

- Coverage: ≥ 90% repo-wide MUST hold; 100% on `hooks/tampering.py` (pure logic).
- Test marks: `@pytest.mark.unit` for unit tests; integration tests under `tests/integration/` use the project default mark.
- **Anti-tautology receipt** (Task 3.3): mandatory; document in PR Change Log.
- Symlink-escape security test (Task 1.1) uses a pytest tmp_path-based symlink; mark `posix-only` if `os.symlink` is unsupported on the target test platform — mirror the `_SKIP_WIN32` shape from Story 1.16 / 2A.0.
- Integration tests for init + scan + trust-hooks use subprocess invocation (mirror Story 2A.0 Tier-1 + the existing `tests/integration/test_walking_skeleton_e2e.py` pattern).

### Previous-story intelligence — what to copy + what to avoid

**Copy from Story 2A.0 (Tier-1 harness):**
- The `_compute_sha256_of_file` shape from `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py:31` — reuse the helper if it's exported, otherwise mirror the implementation.
- The walking_skeleton golden regeneration discipline — drift via `--update-goldens` requires PR-Change-Log explanation.
- The `os_marker: posix` skip pattern for POSIX-only commands.

**Copy from Story 1.10 (Atomic write protocol):**
- The `state.atomic.write_atomic` public function — reuse for `record_trust`. Do NOT roll a separate writer.

**Copy from Story 1.13 (`MockAIRuntime`, `src/sdlc/runtime/mock.py`):**
- The error-context `details` dict pattern: `MockMissError("...", details={"step": "...", "path": "..."})`.
- The fail-loud philosophy applied to `compute_hook_hashes` (symlink-escape, missing root).

**Copy from Story 1.20 (Recovery `sdlc rebuild-state`):**
- The "missing/corrupted store as a *report state*, not an exception" pattern — `detect_tampering` returns a `TamperReport` with `status` field rather than raising.
- The runbook structure at `docs/runbooks/recover-from-state-corruption.md` — mirror in `docs/runbooks/handle-hash-drift.md`.

**Copy from Story 2A.1 (sibling Layer 1 story):**
- The "wire-format frozen reminder" discipline.
- The "fail-once-with-full-list" violation pattern (TamperReport.drift collects ALL drifts, not first-only).
- The decision-protocol explicitness for D1/D2/D3 choices in PR Change Log.

**AVOID (failure modes from Epic 1 retro):**
- **Pattern 1 — Tautological tests.** Task 3.3 anti-tautology receipt prevents this for the most complex logic (drift detection).
- **Pattern 2 — POSIX-only sprawl.** The symlink tests are POSIX-only — mark them at the test level, NOT in `mypy.overrides` or `coverage.omit`.
- **Pattern 4 — Pydantic lax coercion.** `StrictModel` mandatory.
- **Pattern 5 — Review-patch volume crescendo.** LOC caps per file.
- **Pattern 6 — Linter AST blind spots.** This story does NOT extend any AST linter.

### Git intelligence — recent commits

- `0d24517 chore(process): codify per-epic prerequisites as permanent policy` — §7.4 gate cleared by 2A.1; same gate clearance applies to 2A.5.
- `8498ac3 chore(epic-2a-prep): complete DAG approvals + D1 Hypothesis byte-stability + D2 StrictModel` — D2 StrictModel makes `_HookHashStore` strict by default.
- `1edc2e9 feat(2a-0): implement E2E test harness` — your precursor; AC11 / AC7 reference walking_skeleton goldens.
- `b12f033 feat(1.20): implement rebuild-state command and recovery prompt (FR35)` — the closest sibling recovery story; copy report-state-not-exception pattern.
- `d2bde81 feat(1.21): wire-format v1 lock ceremony` — the lock that AC8 must not violate.

### Project structure notes

- `src/sdlc/hooks/` does NOT exist yet. This story creates it (only `tampering.py` + `__init__.py` in 2A.5; `hooks/builtin/*.py`, `hooks/runner.py`, `hooks/payload.py` arrive in **Story 2A.4**).
- The shared file edits with **Story 2A.1**: `src/sdlc/errors/base.py` (2A.1 adds `WorkflowError`; 2A.5 does NOT add a new error class — uses existing `HookError`). No conflict.
- The shared file edits with **Story 2A.2**: `src/sdlc/errors/base.py` (2A.2 adds `SpecialistError`; 2A.5 does not edit it). No conflict.
- The shared file edits with **Story 2A.0**: `src/sdlc/cli/init.py` and `src/sdlc/cli/scan.py` — 2A.5 modifies these. **Layer 1 worktrees `2a-1-workflow-loader` and `2a-5-hook-trust` MUST coordinate via linear-merge** (CONTRIBUTING.md §3.3): whichever lands first defines the baseline goldens; the second rebases + regenerates if needed.
