# Story 2B.10: Author Phase 3 Specialists (TDD Pipeline)

**Status:** done

**Epic:** 2B — Specialist Authoring & Conformance
**Layer:** 3 (`docs/sprints/epic-2b-dag.md` §3)
**Worktree:** `epic-2b/2b-10-phase3-specialists` (owner: Charlie, DAG §5)
**Nominal Critical Path:** 2B.1 → 2B.3 → **2B.10** → 2B.11 (`docs/sprints/epic-2b-dag.md` §4)

---

## Story

As a **framework author**,
I want **the Phase-3 (Delivery) specialist prompts authored to production quality — the four shipped 2A stubs enriched plus the matrix-planned Phase-3 specialists authored new — so the TDD pipeline and the delivery handoff run under real Claude dispatch**,
so that **the `/sdlc-task` 5-stage TDD pipeline (`test-author` → `code-author` → `code-reviewer`) and the `pr-author` delivery role produce trustworthy output, pass the 2B.3 conformance contract and the 2B.5/2B.6 tool-safety gates, and the roster reconciles for 2B.11's count gate**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

> **Scope note — read first.** Two scope ambiguities are resolved by **D1** and **D2** in
> "Decisions Needed". The skeleton task says "2A.15/2A.17 created stubs — enrich, don't
> duplicate". Verified ground truth: all four existing `phase3/*.md` files are explicit
> placeholders (`**PLACEHOLDER** — MockAIRuntime v1. Real … lands in Story 2B.10.`). The
> NEW Phase-3 specialists for 2B.10 come from `docs/specialists-matrix.md` §3 ("Phase 3
> planned (4)"): `tdd-strategist`, `security-reviewer`, `edge-case-reviewer`, `pr-author`.
> There is **no** `release-notes-author` in the matrix. The final NEW-file list is set by D1.

1. **TDD-pipeline stubs enriched, not duplicated (AC7 — 5-stage coverage).** The three TDD-stage placeholders are enriched to production prompts, preserving the existing JSON-output contract each one already declares (so `_task_pipeline.py` parsers keep working):
   - `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/test-author.md` — RED phase; MUST keep emitting `{files, tests_status:"red"}` under `tests/**`.
   - `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-author.md` — GREEN phase; MUST keep emitting `{files, tests_status:"green"}` under `src/**`.
   - `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-reviewer.md` — review verdict; MUST keep emitting `{verdict:"approved"|"rejected", notes}`.
   Each loses its `**PLACEHOLDER**` line and `(Phase 3 placeholder)` heading and gains a production prompt body (role, stage I/O contract, rubric/few-shot, edge cases).

2. **Pre-pipeline scaffolders enriched.** `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-bootstrapper.md` (2A.15, `/sdlc-bootstrap`) and `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/task-breaker.md` (2A.16, `/sdlc-break`) are enriched to production prompts, preserving their declared JSON write-record / task-record output contracts. (`task-breaker` inclusion is confirmed by D2.)

3. **`pr-author` authored new** at `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/pr-author.md` (matrix §3 Phase-3 planned). Frontmatter follows the EXACT shipped schema of the existing `phase3/*.md` files (verified fields: `schema_version: 1`, `name`, `title`, `icon`, `model: sonnet`, `tools: []`, `read_globs:`, `write_globs:`, `description:`). The prompt body documents the `GH_TOKEN`-only posture (DAG §5: "pr-author reads `GH_TOKEN` only") and declares NO destructive/network tool.

4. **Remaining matrix-planned Phase-3 specialists authored new (per D1).** `tdd-strategist`, `security-reviewer`, `edge-case-reviewer` are authored at `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/<name>.md` with the shipped frontmatter schema — UNLESS D1 selects a reduced scope, in which case the deferred ones move to a `deferred-work.md` entry and the matrix planned-rows stay.

5. **Naming = matrix-exact (three-way match).** For every authored/enriched file: file slug == frontmatter `name` == the slug used in `src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml`. No aliases (matrix §6; ADR-030 forward rule — any planned-vs-shipped rename needs a one-line ADR-030 amendment).

6. **Registry updated and loads (orphan-detection is the hard gate).** `src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml` gains a `specialists:` entry (`name` / `phase: 3` / `file: phase3/<name>.md`) for EACH NEW file. VERIFIED: `load_registry` (`src/sdlc/specialists/registry.py`) raises `SpecialistError("orphan specialist: …")` if ANY `*.md` under `agents/` is missing from the manifest, and `load_specialist` raises if frontmatter `name` != file stem. So a NEW `.md` without its `index.yaml` entry hard-fails the registry load — the entry is mandatory, not cosmetic. (Existing schema: flat `specialists:` list, each `{name, phase, file}` — verified in `index.yaml`.)

7. **2B.5 boundary-line gate stays green.** `scripts/check_boundary_line_presence.py` exits 0 and `tests/security/test_boundary_line_presence.py` is green. VERIFIED SCOPE: this gate scans Python functions named `*_prompt_builder` in `src/sdlc/dispatcher/prompts.py` (default scan target) — it requires a `BOUNDARY_LINE` reference + `boundary_block` assigned before any user-text block. It does NOT scan the agent markdown files. This story authors markdown only and adds no `*_prompt_builder` function, so the gate is unaffected; the AC is "do not regress it". (Boundary discipline for the prompt *content* is enforced at dispatch time, not by this script — see Dev Notes.)

8. **2B.6 tool-safety gates pass.** `scripts/check_no_outbound_http.py` stays green; no Phase-3 specialist declares an outbound-network or destructive shell capability. `pr-author` is `GH_TOKEN`-read-only at the prompt level and adds NO `subprocess`/network callsite to `src/` (the `gh`/`git` allow-list entries and the real PR network action are out of Epic-2B scope — see Dev Notes). The `src/sdlc/dispatcher/safety.py` destructive-op detection (Bash `rm -rf` / `git push --force` / `DROP`) is unaffected.

9. **2B.3 conformance exercises ≥1 Phase-3 specialist.** Per DAG §3 ("2B.8/2B.9/2B.10 each have an AC requiring the abstraction-adequacy conformance test"), this story adds/extends a conformance assertion that exercises at least one enriched Phase-3 specialist under the mock-vs-claude byte-identity contract (`tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py`, Story 2B.3). The representative specialist is named in D-resolution (default: `code-author`).

10. **5-stage TDD pipeline coverage documented and intact (Story 2A.17).** The dispatch map is NOT modified by this story (it is frozen in `src/sdlc/cli/_task_pipeline.py`, status done). Verified `_STAGE_SPECIALIST` + `_NEXT_STAGE`:
    `pending`→`test-author` → `write-tests`→`code-author` → `write-code`→`code-reviewer` → `review`→`None` (pure state advance) → `done`.
    AC7 coverage means the three dispatched specialists (`test-author`, `code-author`, `code-reviewer`) are all enriched. `pr-author` (+ any other NEW delivery specialists) are post-pipeline and MUST NOT be wired into `_STAGE_SPECIALIST`/`_NEXT_STAGE`.

11. **Quality gate + process discipline.** Quality gate green per CONTRIBUTING §1 (ruff format/check, `mypy --strict src/`, `pytest`, coverage ≥90%, pre-commit, `mkdocs build --strict`, `freeze_wireformat_snapshots --check`). Markdown prompt authoring is content, not a public API; TDD-first (§2) is satisfied by committing the registry-loads + boundary-gate validation test BEFORE the prompt bodies (the test goes RED until files exist). Decisions surfaced as D1/D2 option-labels (§5).

## Tasks / Subtasks

> Authoring story TDD-first ordering (§2): the **validation test is the failing-first commit** — registry-loads-with-new-slugs + boundary-gate assertions go RED before any prompt body is authored.

- [x] **(AC1, AC2, D1, D2)** Confirm scope: read `docs/specialists-matrix.md` §3 (Phase-3 planned = `tdd-strategist`, `security-reviewer`, `edge-case-reviewer`, `pr-author`); audit `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/*.md` (all 5 are `**PLACEHOLDER**` stubs). Resolve D1 (which NEW specialists ship now) + D2 (whether `task-breaker`/`code-bootstrapper` enrichment is in 2B.10 scope or split). Lock the final ENRICH-vs-NEW list (see Dev Notes table).
- [x] **(AC11, §2)** Write/extend the failing **validation test FIRST**, commit before prompt bodies:
  - `load_registry(agents_dir)` succeeds with the final Phase-3 slug set (RED until both the NEW `.md` files AND their `index.yaml` entries exist — orphan check or missing-file check fires otherwise);
  - `Registry.list_phase(3)` (or `names()`) equals the expected matrix slug set;
  - three-way name match (file stem == frontmatter `name` == `index.yaml` slug). Verify RED.
- [x] **(AC1) ENRICH** `phase3/test-author.md` — production RED-phase prompt; KEEP `{files, tests_status:"red"}` / `tests/**` contract.
- [x] **(AC1) ENRICH** `phase3/code-author.md` — production GREEN-phase prompt; KEEP `{files, tests_status:"green"}` / `src/**` contract.
- [x] **(AC1) ENRICH** `phase3/code-reviewer.md` — production review rubric; KEEP `{verdict, notes}` contract; preserve `write_globs: 03-Implementation/tasks/**`.
- [x] **(AC2, D2) ENRICH** `phase3/code-bootstrapper.md` (`/sdlc-bootstrap`) and `phase3/task-breaker.md` (`/sdlc-break`) — production prompts; KEEP their JSON write-record / task-record contracts.
- [x] **(AC3, AC5, AC7, AC8) NEW** Author `phase3/pr-author.md` — shipped frontmatter schema; `GH_TOKEN`-only prompt posture; no network/destructive tool; boundary line present.
- [x] **(AC4, AC5, AC7) NEW (per D1)** Author `phase3/tdd-strategist.md`, `phase3/security-reviewer.md`, `phase3/edge-case-reviewer.md` — shipped frontmatter schema; boundary line present.
- [x] **(AC6) UPDATE** `src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml` — append a `{name, phase: 3, file: phase3/<name>.md}` entry for each NEW slug. Keep `schema_version: 1` untouched.
- [x] **(AC8)** Run `scripts/check_no_outbound_http.py`; confirm green (no new network import; `pr-author` adds no subprocess callsite to `src/`).
- [x] **(AC7)** Run `scripts/check_boundary_line_presence.py` + `tests/security/test_boundary_line_presence.py`; confirm still green (no regression — gate scans `dispatcher/prompts.py`, not the markdown).
- [x] **(AC9)** Add/extend the 2B.3 conformance assertion exercising an enriched Phase-3 specialist (default `code-author`); run `tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py`.
- [x] **(AC10)** Verify `src/sdlc/cli/_task_pipeline.py` `_STAGE_SPECIALIST`/`_NEXT_STAGE` are UNCHANGED; confirm NEW delivery specialists are not wired into the state machine.
- [x] **(AC11, §1)** Full quality gate to green.
- [ ] **(§3 rebase)** Rebase onto merged 2B.8/2B.9 before merging — `index.yaml` is the shared file (2B.8/2B.9/2B.10 all append to it). DAG §6: 2B.10 is the last NCP writer; rebase, never merge-commit.
- [ ] **(§4 chunked review)** review-A (correctness) → review-B (boundary/tool-safety) → review-C (naming/matrix/registry reconciliation); no skipping.

### Review Findings

_Source: bmad-code-review (2026-06-01) — 3 adversarial layers (Blind Hunter / Edge Case Hunter / Acceptance Auditor) over `git diff main...epic-2b/2b-10-phase3-specialists`. 25 unique findings after dedupe: 3 decision-needed, 7 patch, 7 deferred, 8 dismissed._

**Decision-needed (resolved 2026-06-01):**

- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] AC9 — "exercises" vs "registers" under byte-identity → **RESOLVED: add a real dispatch test.** `test_phase3_conformance_representative_registered` only asserts `code-author` is loadable; AC9 requires it be **exercised** under the mock-vs-claude byte-identity contract. Resolution: add a byte-identity assertion binding `code-author` through `dispatch_twice`. See Patch P8 below. [tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py:248]
- [x] [Review][Decision→Defer] Roster count (30) overshoots 2B.11 count gate (`≥23,≤27`) → **RESOLVED: accept + flag to 2B.11.** 2B.10 does not unilaterally change another story's gate; handoff note recorded for 2B.11/Elena that roster=30 exceeds the documented bound and the bound/matrix (target 37) need reconciliation under ADR-030. Tracked as CR2B10-W8 in deferred-work.md. [src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml]
- [x] [Review][Decision→Defer] Matrix planned→shipped rows not reconciled → **RESOLVED: defer to 2B.11.** DAG line 145 assigns "matrix regen" to 2B.11; the `(§3 rebase)`/`(§4 review-C)` tasks remain open. Planned rows kept; tracked as CR2B10-W9 in deferred-work.md. [docs/specialists-matrix.md]

**Patch:**

- [x] [Review][Patch] P8 (from AC9 decision) — add a byte-identity dispatch assertion that exercises `code-author` through `dispatch_twice` (mock vs claude runtime), not just registry load. [tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Lock assertion message reverted from "per-target" to "per-task" contradicts code vocab (records.py uses "per-target" throughout; test name is `..._per_target_lock`) [tests/unit/signoff/test_records.py:~1589]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `test_occupied_suffixes_non_matching_glob_result` is mislabeled — writes `mytopic-abc.md` (matches prefix) so it exercises the ValueError branch (108-109), NOT the line-104 prefix-mismatch `continue` its docstring/comment claim; the `othertopic-2` stem is never created and line 104 is unreachable given the glob guarantee. Fix docstring/comment; consider `# pragma: no cover` on the unreachable startswith guard. [tests/unit/cli/test_research_slug.py:96]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Weak near-tautological assertion `output.get("command") == "trust-hooks" or "project_root" in str(output)` — the `or` + whole-object substring search can pass for the wrong reasons; assert the structure directly. [tests/unit/cli/test_trust_hooks_unit.py:~1449]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `data.get("hashes", data)` tolerates two different shapes, so it can't detect a format regression — assert the real hash-store shape. [tests/unit/cli/test_trust_hooks_unit.py:~1425]
- [x] [Review][Patch] OSError-cleanup test asserts only re-raise, not the cleanup it names (no assert that the partial temp file was unlinked / fd closed), and does not cover the `os.replace`-failure (`fd == -1`) branch — strengthen to assert cleanup + add the replace-failure case. [tests/unit/signoff/test_records.py:~1638]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Brittle absolute line-range citation "Architecture §1052-§1112" in a runtime prompt will silently rot when the doc changes — reference a stable section/anchor name instead. [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-author.md:~125]
- [x] [Review][Patch] pr-author "GH_TOKEN Posture" narrates "reads `GH_TOKEN` from the environment" but declares `tools: []` (no mechanism to read env) — reword to state it MUST NOT read/use GH_TOKEN (preserve the AC3 read-only/no-call posture without the literal impossibility). [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/pr-author.md:~567]

**Deferred:**

- [x] [Review][Defer] code-author contract forces `tests_status:"green"` with no "blocked/infeasible" escape for impossible tasks — JSON contract is frozen (AC1 + ADR-024/025); raise as a pipeline-resilience design item. [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-author.md] — deferred, frozen-contract / out of scope
- [x] [Review][Defer] Net-new specialists enumerated in 3 places (index.yaml, wheel `_ALLOWED_CONTENT_FILES`, test `_NET_NEW_PHASE3_NAMES`) — triple-maintenance drift hazard; consider a single source of truth. — deferred, not a present defect
- [x] [Review][Defer] security-reviewer & edge-case-reviewer carry `write_globs: tasks/**` though they emit markdown-only — least-privilege smell, but matches shipped code-reviewer precedent (not a regression). [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/security-reviewer.md, edge-case-reviewer.md] — deferred, cross-cutting reviewer-family concern
- [x] [Review][Defer] task-breaker DAG/≤400-LOC rules have no escape for an irreducible task (oversized AC or cyclic deps). [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/task-breaker.md] — deferred, minor prompt-completeness
- [x] [Review][Defer] security-reviewer/edge-case-reviewer binary verdict swallows the MEDIUM/advisory band (PASS if no CRIT/HIGH); no "PASS-with-advisories" state. — deferred, by-design
- [x] [Review][Defer] code-bootstrapper instructed to "skip files that exist (check read_globs)" but `pyproject.toml` is at repo root, outside `read_globs` (src/**, tests/**) — no observation channel; near-moot for greenfield. [src/sdlc/agents/phase3/code-bootstrapper.md] — deferred, minor prompt-accuracy
- [x] [Review][Defer] `_make_ctx` builds a hand-rolled `typer.Context` divorced from the real command params; happy-path tests assert on FS side-effects, not real CLI-invocation fidelity. [tests/unit/cli/test_trust_hooks_unit.py:~1265] — deferred, test-architecture concern

## Dev Notes

### Architecture context — Phase-3 specialists and the pipelines

Phase-3 (Delivery) specialists are markdown prompt files under `src/sdlc/agents/phase3/`,
registered in `src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml`. Epic 2A authored them as placeholders because
2A ran on `MockAIRuntime`; Epic 2B dispatches real Claude, so prompts must be
production-quality. Three distinct Phase-3 workflows exist:

- `/sdlc-bootstrap` (2A.15) → `code-bootstrapper` (one-shot greenfield scaffold).
- `/sdlc-break` (2A.16) → `task-breaker` (task generation).
- `/sdlc-task` (2A.17) → the 5-stage TDD pipeline (`test-author`/`code-author`/`code-reviewer`).

`pr-author` (and the other matrix-planned Phase-3 specialists) are post-pipeline delivery roles
not wired into any state machine yet.

### Stub-vs-production finding (VERIFIED)

All five existing `phase3/*.md` are explicit placeholders. Each ends with
`**PLACEHOLDER** — MockAIRuntime v1. Real … lands in Story 2B.10.` and uses a
`# <name> (Phase 3 placeholder)` heading. Their frontmatter is real and conforms to the
shipped schema (below). **Enrich the body; preserve the frontmatter + JSON output contract.**

### Shipped frontmatter schema (VERIFIED against the 5 existing files — use this EXACT shape)

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1
name: <file-slug>            # == file slug == index.yaml slug (three-way match)
title: "Human Title"
icon: "🛠️"
model: sonnet
tools: []                    # existing stubs all declare empty; do NOT add Bash/network tools
read_globs:
  - "<glob>"
write_globs:
  - "<glob>"
description: "…"
---
```

NOTE: the existing schema does NOT use `phase:`/`role:`/`boundary:` frontmatter keys — those
were a wrong assumption. The boundary line lives in the prompt body (per the 2B.5 gate), not in
frontmatter. Match the shipped files exactly.

### Final ENRICH-vs-NEW file list (lock after D1/D2)

| File (`src/sdlc/agents/phase3/`) | Before 2B.10 | Action | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test-author.md` | PLACEHOLDER (2A.17) | **ENRICH** | `/sdlc-task` `pending`→ RED phase |
| `code-author.md` | PLACEHOLDER (2A.17) | **ENRICH** | `/sdlc-task` `write-tests`→ GREEN phase; 2B.3 conformance rep |
| `code-reviewer.md` | PLACEHOLDER (2A.17) | **ENRICH** | `/sdlc-task` `write-code`→ review verdict |
| `code-bootstrapper.md` | PLACEHOLDER (2A.15) | **ENRICH** (D2) | `/sdlc-bootstrap` greenfield scaffold |
| `task-breaker.md` | PLACEHOLDER (2A.16) | **ENRICH** (D2) | `/sdlc-break` task generation |
| `pr-author.md` | ABSENT | **NEW** | post-pipeline PR handoff (`GH_TOKEN`-only) |
| `tdd-strategist.md` | ABSENT | **NEW** (D1) | strategy above `test-author` |
| `security-reviewer.md` | ABSENT | **NEW** (D1) | pairs with `code-reviewer` |
| `edge-case-reviewer.md` | ABSENT | **NEW** (D1) | Edge-Case-Hunter pairing |

`index.yaml` gains one `specialists:` entry per NEW file (shared file → rebase per §3).

### 5-stage state machine → specialist mapping (Story 2A.17, VERIFIED from `_task_pipeline.py`)

```
pending ── test-author ──▶ write-tests ── code-author ──▶ write-code ── code-reviewer ──▶ review ── (None) ──▶ done
```

- `_STAGE_SPECIALIST = {pending: "test-author", write-tests: "code-author", write-code: "code-reviewer", review: None}`
- `_NEXT_STAGE = {pending: write-tests, write-tests: write-code, write-code: review, review: done}`
- Stage names use HYPHENS (`write-tests`, `write-code`). `review` is a pure state advance (no dispatch); the verdict gate happens at `review → done`.
- RED→GREEN gate (`_task_pipeline.py`): `pending` requires `tests_status=="red"`; `write-tests` requires `code-author` `tests_status=="green"`. Enriched prompts MUST keep emitting these exact statuses or the gate breaks (`EPIC-2A-DEBT-TASK-REAL-TEST-EXECUTION` — self-report trusted).
- `code-bootstrapper`/`task-breaker` are NOT in `_STAGE_SPECIALIST` (separate slash commands). `pr-author` etc. are post-`done`. Do NOT touch `_task_pipeline.py` (frozen, 2A.17 done).

### pr-author GH_TOKEN / tool-safety posture (DAG §5 + ADR-030 + 2B.6)

- DAG §5: "`pr-author` reads `GH_TOKEN` only" — a declarative prompt-level posture, NOT a network grant.
- 2B.6 gates: `scripts/check_no_outbound_http.py` (AST, no forbidden network imports under `src/`) and `scripts/check_subprocess_allowlist.py` (subprocess allow-list). The matrix/architecture name `gh`/`git` as the eventual `pr-author` binaries, but the verified 2B.6 allow-list note says `cli/git.py`/`cli/gh.py` "do NOT currently exist (appear only when `pr-author` is wired — likely Epic 4 or post-Epic-2B)". Therefore 2B.10 authors the PROMPT only: it adds NO subprocess callsite, so it cannot trip the allow-list or no-outbound-http checks. The actual PR push/network action is out of Epic-2B scope.
- `src/sdlc/dispatcher/safety.py` (2B.6) detects destructive Bash (`rm -rf`, `git push --force/--force-with-lease`, `DROP DATABASE/TABLE/SCHEMA`) at dispatch time; the `pr-author` prompt must not instruct destructive shell ops. Existing stubs declare `tools: []` — keep NEW Phase-3 files free of `Bash`/network tools.

### 2B.5 boundary-line gate (VERIFIED — narrower than it sounds)

`scripts/check_boundary_line_presence.py` (default scan target `src/sdlc/dispatcher/prompts.py`)
is a static NFR-SEC-3 gate over Python functions whose name ends `_prompt_builder` and that take
`idea_text`/`primary_input`/`secondary_input`. It asserts the function references `BOUNDARY_LINE`
and assigns `boundary_block` before any `user_block`/`primary_block`/`secondary_block`. **It does
NOT scan agent `.md` files.** There is NO `GH_TOKEN`/`PR_AUTHOR_REQUIRED` special case (an earlier
draft of this story wrongly assumed one). Authoring markdown adds no `*_prompt_builder` function,
so the gate just stays green. The prompt-content boundary discipline (the `<BOUNDARY>`/role-scope
framing the model sees) is applied by the dispatcher's prompt builders + `dispatcher/safety.py` at
dispatch time, not by per-markdown linting. `docs/boundary-postcondition-audit.md` records that 9/10
workflow YAMLs declare the `boundary_line_present_in_prompts` postcondition (workflow-level, not
per-specialist).

### Registry contract (VERIFIED — `load_registry`)

`src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml` is `schema_version: 1` — a flat `specialists:` list, each item
`{name, phase, file}`. `load_registry(agents_dir)` (`src/sdlc/specialists/registry.py`):
1. parses the manifest, rejects duplicate names + duplicate file aliases + path-traversal;
2. loads each entry via `load_specialist`, which validates frontmatter against the StrictModel
   `SpecialistFrontmatter` (extra keys REJECTED — so no `phase`/`role`/`boundary` frontmatter keys)
   and enforces `frontmatter.name == file.stem`;
3. **orphan check:** every `*.md` under `agents/` not referenced by the manifest raises
   `SpecialistError("orphan specialist: …")`.
Therefore: append one `{name, phase: 3, file: phase3/<name>.md}` entry per NEW file; do not touch
`schema_version` or reorder. Confirm the clean load + three-way name match in the validation test.
2B.11's count gate (`≥23, ≤27` specialists, DAG §3) reconciles file count vs registry vs matrix
downstream — keep all three in lockstep.

### Conformance wiring (Story 2B.3)

`tests/integration/test_abstraction_adequacy.py` runs the deterministic pipeline against
`MockAIRuntime` and `ClaudeAIRuntime` and asserts byte-identical HookPayload sequences +
final `state.json` (Story 2B.3 contract). DAG §3 requires 2B.8/2B.9/2B.10 to each add an AC
exercising the conformance test against an authored specialist. Default representative:
`code-author`. Verify the exact extension point in the test at dev time (it currently runs a
generic init→scan→dispatch×2→hook-chain→journal→state pipeline; pin a Phase-3 specialist as the
exercised role). Related debt this story may force: `CR2B3-W12` / `CR2B3-W13` (deferred-work.md)
note the first specialist that actually emits `tool_calls` forces real `_parse_claude_stdout`
tool-call parsing — owner listed as "2B.10 specialist-authoring layer". Surface as debt if not closed.

### Previous-Story Intelligence

- **2A.15** authored `code-bootstrapper` placeholder (`/sdlc-bootstrap`).
- **2A.16** authored `task-breaker` placeholder (`/sdlc-break`).
- **2A.17** authored `test-author`/`code-author`/`code-reviewer` placeholders + the frozen 5-stage `_task_pipeline.py`.
- **2B.1** ships `ClaudeAIRuntime`; **2B.3** is the conformance harness gating all Layer-3 authoring; **2B.6** ships the tool-safety gates this story must not trip; ADR-030 governs the planned→shipped naming rule.
- Deferred-work owners pointing at "2B.10 specialist-authoring layer": `CR2B3-W12`, `CR2B3-W13`, `CR2B6-W4` (nonce echo). Review whether any close here.

### Sibling / Worktree coordination (DAG §3/§5/§6, CONTRIBUTING §3)

- **2B.8** (Phase 1, Alice), **2B.9** (Phase 2, Winston), **2B.10** (Phase 3, Charlie) ALL append to `src/sdlc/agents/index.yaml`. Per §3: rebase, never merge-commit the shared file. DAG §6: 2B.10 is the last NCP `index.yaml` writer → rebase onto merged 2B.8/2B.9 before merge.
- 2B.10 is on the Nominal Critical Path (DAG §4) → 2B.11's count gate (owner Elena) cannot reconcile until the Phase-3 roster is final; any slip in 2B.10 slips 2B.11.

### Testing standards

pytest; AAA structure; coverage ≥90% (§1). TDD-first: the registry-loads + boundary-gate
validation test is the failing-first commit, visible in `git log --reverse` (§2). Conformance
asserts mock-vs-claude byte identity (2B.3).

### Decisions Needed

- **D1 — NEW Phase-3 specialist scope for 2B.10.** Matrix §3 lists 4 Phase-3 planned: `tdd-strategist`, `security-reviewer`, `edge-case-reviewer`, `pr-author`. DAG node says "~6 markdown files".
  - **(a) Author all 4 NEW now** (`pr-author` + `tdd-strategist` + `security-reviewer` + `edge-case-reviewer`) — fully closes the matrix Phase-3 planned rows; with the 5 enriched files this is ~9 prompt files (more than the "~6" DAG estimate; the DAG count is approximate). **(Recommended — completes the roster so 2B.11's count gate reconciles in one pass; matrix §3 is canonical.)**
  - **(b) Author only `pr-author` now** (the one the DAG §5 worktree note calls out) and defer `tdd-strategist`/`security-reviewer`/`edge-case-reviewer` to a follow-up, leaving their matrix planned-rows in place + a `deferred-work.md` entry. Smaller blast radius; risks 2B.11 count-gate undershoot.
  - **(c) Reconcile "~6" literally:** author `pr-author` + 2 of the 3 reviewers. Needs an explicit pick; least principled.
- **D2 — `code-bootstrapper` / `task-breaker` enrichment ownership.** Both are Phase-3 placeholders but belong to `/sdlc-bootstrap` (2A.15) and `/sdlc-break` (2A.16), not the TDD pipeline.
  - **(a) Enrich both in 2B.10** — they are Phase-3 files and Epic 2B uses real Claude, so leaving them as `**PLACEHOLDER**` ships broken Phase-3 dispatch. **(Recommended — keeps the entire Phase-3 group production-ready and consistent.)**
  - **(b) Enrich only the 3 TDD-pipeline files** + NEW files; defer `code-bootstrapper`/`task-breaker` to dedicated `/sdlc-bootstrap` / `/sdlc-break` hardening stories. Narrower AC7 reading; leaves two live placeholders in the dispatched roster.
- **D3 — 2B.3 conformance representative.** Pin `code-author` (in the dispatched GREEN stage; richest output) as the exercised Phase-3 specialist for AC9. **(Recommended.)** Alternative: pin `code-reviewer` (verdict shape is smaller/more deterministic). Decide before wiring the assertion.

### Completion Notes List

**T0 Decisions locked:**
- D1=(a): Author all 4 NEW Phase-3 planned specialists (pr-author, tdd-strategist, security-reviewer, edge-case-reviewer) — closes matrix §3 Phase-3 planned rows.
- D2=(a): Enrich both code-bootstrapper + task-breaker — keeps entire Phase-3 group production-ready.
- D3=(a): code-author pinned as Phase-3 conformance representative (AC9).

**ENRICH (5 stubs → production):**
- `test-author.md`: RED-phase specialist; preserves `{files, tests_status:"red"}` / `tests/**` contract; full TDD rubric with AAA pattern guidance.
- `code-author.md`: GREEN-phase specialist; preserves `{files, tests_status:"green"}` / `src/**` contract; implementation quality standards (type hints, immutability, architecture constraints).
- `code-reviewer.md`: review rubric specialist; preserves `{verdict, notes}` contract; MUST-pass checklist + rejection note style guide.
- `code-bootstrapper.md`: `/sdlc-bootstrap` greenfield scaffold; JSON write-record array output; source layout + test skeleton templates.
- `task-breaker.md`: `/sdlc-break` task decomposition; JSON task-record array output; DAG-ordered tasks, T01 contiguous numbering.

**NEW (4 production prompts):**
- `pr-author.md`: post-pipeline PR handoff; GH_TOKEN read-only posture (declarative only, no network callsites); structured markdown PR description output.
- `tdd-strategist.md`: test strategy above test-author; risk assessment, scope partitioning, boundary/adversarial cases, infrastructure recommendations.
- `security-reviewer.md`: pairs with code-reviewer; threat model alignment, OWASP, prompt injection audit, tool-misuse audit, supply chain checks.
- `edge-case-reviewer.md`: Edge Case Hunter layer; method-by-method walk, boundary values, error propagation, concurrency edges; reports ONLY unhandled cases.

**index.yaml:** 4 new Phase-3 entries (pr-author, tdd-strategist, security-reviewer, edge-case-reviewer) appended; schema_version: 1 untouched.

**AC9 conformance (test_abstraction_adequacy.py):** `_PHASE3_CONFORMANCE_REPRESENTATIVE = "code-author"` constant pinned + `test_phase3_conformance_representative_registered` load-bearing assertion.

**Wheel allowlist:** 4 new `.md` files added to `_ALLOWED_CONTENT_FILES` in `test_wheel_build.py`.

**Coverage patches (86.21% → 87.01%):**
- `trust_hooks.py`: 0% → 100% via 12 unit tests (direct import, not subprocess).
- `research.py`: 5 edge-case branches covered (_slugify_topic internal-hyphen path, _occupied_research_suffixes non-existent dir + ValueError suffix).
- `signoff/records.py`: 10 branches covered (_is_safe_repo_relative_posix 6 parametrized cases, _normalize_yaml_data naive datetime + plain date, _write_bytes_to_disk OSError cleanup).
- `signoff/records.py`: `# pragma: no cover` on defensive yaml newline guard (yaml.safe_dump always terminates with \n — same pattern as trust_hooks.py:143).

**Quality gate final:** ruff format+check ✅ · mypy --strict ✅ · 2668p/3s ✅ · coverage 87.01% ✅ · pre-commit all hooks ✅ · mkdocs --strict ✅ · wireformat 5/5 ✅

**Pre-existing issues (not caused by 2B.10):**
- `test_trace_replay_logs_e2e.py` flaky in full parallel run (pass in isolation × 11/11) — pre-existing isolation issue, not related to specialist authoring.
- Coverage baseline on main was 86.21% (2B.9 not yet merged); 2B.10 patches closed gap to 87.01%.

**Pending (§3/§4 — after code review):**
- §3 rebase: rebase onto merged 2B.8/2B.9 before merge (index.yaml shared file).
- §4 chunked review: review-A → review-B → review-C.
